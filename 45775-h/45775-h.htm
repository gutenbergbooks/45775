<h3>I. EXTERNAL EVIDENCE</h3>

<p>Women are often limited in their amusements and in their hobbies
for lack of power or of knowledge to use the requisite implements.
We may wield the needle, the brush, kitchen utensils, even
the spade and the trowel, but what knowledge have we of the
chisel, the plane, the saw, or even the friendly gimlet and the
screw-driver?</p>

<p>The scissors answer many purposes until the points are broken,
but how helpless we are with a screw or a saw, how futile are our
attempts to adjust a loose door-handle, or to set the knives of a
mowing machine! It is humiliating to call for help in such simple
jobs, and tantalising not to be able to enjoy the carpenter's bench
as our men-folk do in their hours of leisure.</p>

<p>A really active hobby, one entailing exercise of many muscles,
otherwise resting, does help to keep a well-balanced mind and a
healthy body. It saves one from fretfulness, from too great introspection;
it keeps one cheerful and changes one's attitude of mind
when change is needed.</p>

<p>It is possible that the management of big things falls into men's
hands because from babyhood they have dealt with larger things
than women, and through handling manageable things from an
early age have developed the constructive faculty more thoroughly.
The little girl deals with 'wee' things: stitches are small, dolls are
small; there is a fatal tendency sometimes to 'niggle,' to 'finick'&mdash;not
that men-folk are immune from this&mdash;to love uniformity
and tidiness for their own sakes, to seek regularity rather than
utility. The little girl, however, must, unless she is too thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
supervised, exercise some ingenuity in planning a doll's dress out
of a cutting from the rag-bag; but her amusements and hobbies
tend to pin her down to small things, and she does not rise far
enough from her immediate surroundings. The dress of her little
doll will follow the prevailing fashion. Originality in dress is
eccentricity.</p>

<p>The girl takes pains to carry out her work (neatness is often the
sole aim put before her), the boy finds methods. The girl hovers
round the well-known place, the boy makes a bee-line to fresh
fields. See how this affects reading: the girl still hankers after
<i>What Katy Did, What Katy Did Next</i>, while the boy of her age
is reading Jules Verne or Ballantyne or Henty, or if there is
open access to shelves in the Free Library near him, you see him
finding books on Airships, Submarines, Carpentry, or Engineering.</p>

<p>We started our voluntary classes with these ideas in mind,
and at first allowed girls to choose an indoor occupation in the two
winter terms instead of outdoor games. Many girls preferred
games, but others chose Art or First Aid or Cookery or Handwork
or Needlework. They had to work at least a term at the chosen
occupation. We felt that the girls gained great benefit from the
hobbies, not only in the additional happiness of working at what
they enjoyed, but in an increase of freshness of mind for other
work. This year we have gone still farther and have given each
girl one period of voluntary work in addition to a whole afternoon
for games or gardening; moreover, the four lowest forms have
each one period of class work in toy-making; yet even now the
children say that the time is too short. It is really amusing to see
a change of classes in the woodwork-room; the first class dare not
and cannot stay a minute after the bell has rung, for the second
class is in and already at work.</p>

<p>I have tried to find out what is the great attraction to the child
in the handwork lessons; the children's appreciation of the subject
will be found in Section II. Probably the strongest attractions
are: firstly, they see the building up of a piece of work and
the result pleases them (at all events, until they do something
better); secondly, they are actively employed, learning by doing,
not learning by listening; and, lastly, they love the cheerful noise
of the hammer and the saw and friendly conversation.</p>

<p>It is hard to estimate the value of handwork in education, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
one cannot separate the influence of one subject in the curriculum,
but one is tempted to say that it has a beneficial effect upon the
child's attitude toward work in general; she looks into the why
and wherefore of an object in order to see how it is made; unconsciously
she adopts the same attitude toward things abstract.
She learns to appreciate accuracy and to detect error, but how far
she applies this to subjects other than handwork it is hard to say.
It is possible, also, that handwork helps to develop the sense of
justice.</p>

<p>Certainly the girl who has had a course in handwork does take
a more intelligent interest in things around her, and does find out
a way of 'setting about' a piece of work by herself. She has
something pleasant and profitable to think about; she becomes
more businesslike; in the lesson itself she resents interruption
(this was the case when the photographer came for illustrations
for this book); more strangely still, she plays no tricks with glue-pot
or tools, although she has innumerable opportunities for
mischief. The joy over the finished article is greater than the
spirit of mischief. She realises how short the time is when there
is work to be done, and looks out for devices for saving time,
putting tools in handy places, saving pieces of wood of useful sizes
to avoid sawing, and so on.</p>

<p>There is a spirit of earnest endeavour abroad in the handwork
class which prevents a girl from throwing aside in a pet something
she has done badly; she does not give up in disgust; she finds
out the cause of the failure and tries again and again until she gets
better results. It is no unusual thing to find a girl return to a job
that, five or six weeks before, she had thought finished, and do
it again, because her progress with other articles has made her
dissatisfied with her previous standard. This comes, not from
suggestion from outside, but from the development of the child's
own judgement. These are the things which show what is the real
value of this training.</p>


<h3>II. INTERNAL EVIDENCE</h3>

<p>In order to find from internal evidence the educational value of
toy-making, the following questions were put to the two lowest
classes (ages ten to eleven). The girls were told to write frankly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
what they really thought, not what they thought might satisfy
the mistress.</p>

<p>To the question, "If you like handwork, say why; if not, say
why you do not," out of forty-five papers one answer only was
against handwork&mdash;"Because I do not like sawing." The answers
in favour were of this type:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Because we can make what we like."</p>

<p>"Because I like sawing and hammering."</p>

<p>"Because it is nice to see the things when they are finished."</p>

<p>"Because you can make interesting things."</p>

<p>"Because it is interesting making things out of wood like boys."</p>

<p>"Because I make useful things."</p></blockquote>

<p>The favourite tools were the hammer and saw. There was considerable
difference of opinion on the question, "Has it done you
any good?" A fair number think it has made them careful or
patient or more useful; others seem to think that the exercise in
sawing has some good effect on the arms; one says her "fingers
are better for music." Others see in handwork a pleasant occupation
for future grown-up days; another thinks it has made her
"not so flabby and fat."</p>

<p>If they admit that it has cured them of any faults (and they are
not very ready to do this), the chief are laziness, clumsiness, and
carelessness. To the last question, "Will it be of any use to you
when you are grown up?" the majority look forward to the joy of
mending their little girls' toys. (Not one mentions a little boy;
is he expected to mend his own?) Others will make things
instead of buying them ready-made. Some look forward to
mending broken chairs or door-handles. One says: "It will
teach me to earn my fortune," and finally one writes philosophically:
"Ordepents." (No! handwork does not cure bad spelling.)</p>

<p>The girls of the next highest forms (ages eleven to twelve) were
given the <i>questionnaire</i> as suggestions and were asked to write an
essay on handwork. From them we get the 'home' point of view,
the views of the mother, father, sceptical brothers, and of the
younger children, who appear to clamour for the toys.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Handwork is my favourite lesson next to Botany. It is a
delightful pastime for myself and a great amusement for
my little brother when it is finished. 'Have you finished
the swing yet?' is the usual question which greets me every
Thursday evening. When I am able to do handwork extra
nicely I shall do a very nice piece of work and keep it as long
as I can, and when I get old it will remind me of youth."</p>

<p>"My brother tries to make some of the things I bring home.
My sister likes the swing and uses it for her dolls."</p>

<p>"It is a source of enjoyment to most children, but until I
entered this school I had never heard of girls being taught
it. I enjoy this so much that I hope to buy some tools
and wood and do some work at home. My three brothers
tease me terribly and call me the 'left-handed carpenter,'
because I always work with my left hand. I am not
satisfied with the handwork I have done at present, but
hope greatly to improve. I enjoy making useful things
because they make very useful presents at all times. I
should like to teach handwork to others, as I think it
so interesting. I have discovered that handwork needs
patience and neatness in every way."</p>

<p>"I have learnt that everything must be done properly, because
I made a motor-car and gave it to my little sister, but she
happened to drop it and it came unstuck. My little
brother thinks it's silly for girls to learn handwork, and
everything I bring home he says, 'I should not have done
it like that,' and goes on to explain how he would have done
it, although he has never learnt himself. I don't like the
part much where you have to prepare everything to put
together. I like putting it together and then you can see
something for your work."</p></blockquote>

<p>Some show the ethical value of the training; the need of
patience seems to appeal most forcibly to children who are making
their first attempts at handwork.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"To make toys and other wooden things teaches us to be
patient, for often just at a critical moment something will
come unstuck and we have to begin all over again. The
top of the roundabout which I am now making has come
off three or four times, and consequently it has taken me
about twice as long to make as it would if all had gone
smoothly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sometimes you have to wait for a piece of wood to stick. The
other Friday I was waiting for a piece to stick and after a
while I went on, thinking it had got stuck; unluckily it
had not and it came off. That very same piece of wood
has come off every day except to-day. This shows any one
that one needs time and patience. Also you have to wait
a while because some one has run off with the glue-pot, or
else I find my file or gimlet disappeared."</p>

<p>"When I first began handwork I could not knock a nail in
straight or else I would hit my fingers. But I can now
knock a nail in straight and without knocking my fingers.
I can saw much more quickly than when I first began."</p>

<p>"It teaches us a great lesson of patience. For instance, it is
very trying to have to sit or stand for quite a long while
holding some little refractory piece of wood that will not
stick however much one tries: but it is no good getting
cross, for the work will not be finished if we do not stick the
little piece of wood or paper."</p>

<p>"Once mother told me I had not any idea for anything, but
now she says I am much better, this being one result of
handwork."</p>

<p>"Handwork, I think, has cured me of one fault and that is
inaccuracy, for if the wood is not the proper length, it will
not fit on to the thing which is being made. I have never
done this kind of work before, but I think it does help us
when we are grown up; one way is that everything must be
accurate; and it is also very nice to make things."</p>

<p>"I find that handwork helps me greatly, as I am bad at my
drawing and needlework."</p>

<p>"I love using the saws and hammers. Mother is going to give
me a set of fretwork tools so that I can put fancy tops to
my frames, etc. If I had a little sister or brother I would
make a motor or train, but as I am the only one, I make
things for ornaments. Next I shall make a table with the
two sides to let down, or one with a separate leaf to put in.
Handwork teaches you to be exact and to hold things
delicately. It is very awkward to hammer a nail into a
thin leg of a table or chair, because they wobble over."</p>

<p>"I think handwork is very interesting and it has taught me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
patience. I am not allowed to read more than half an hour
after I have done my homework and practice because my
eyes are weak, and as I am what some people call a bookworm
I used to miss reading a great deal, but now I do handwork
in my spare time. One day I hope to complete my
doll's house, its garage and furniture, but I have not finished
the house yet. I like making such things as chairs and tables
best of all. Handwork lessons were unknown to me until I
came to this school nearly two terms ago, and at first Mamma
was always telling me that she would not let me do any
more at home, until I thought of putting paper on the floor,
which keeps the shavings and sawdust from untidying the
floor. I always do this now, and when the paper is taken
up I do not have so much trouble as that of picking the
pieces off the mat and then sweeping the floor before I go
to bed."</p>

<p>"Handwork also helps to make one accurate and careful;
perhaps your fingers 'were all thumbs,' as the saying goes,
before you started handwork, but you find that after say a
month your fingers would be able to touch a frail thing
without breaking it."</p></blockquote>

<p>Their desire to make and remake varies between 'pleasure
toys' and useful articles; one suspects sometimes a desire to
appease the vexation of the 'house-proud' mother when there is
much disorder caused at home with shavings and sawdust.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I can not only make toys, but useful things such as dish
stands, brackets, photo frames, also easels to stand photographs
on."</p>

<p>"I like handwork. For voluntary work I do handwork, and
it is also our first lesson on Friday afternoon. I like it
because it helps us to make useful things. For voluntary
work I am making a medicine chest. It will be handy,
because we always have a great deal of medicine at home.
Last term I made a knife-box, and it was useful, because
Mama's was getting old. My favourite tools at handwork
are the saw and hammer. Next term I want to make a
writing-case and a Red Cross motor."</p>

<p>"I enjoy going to handwork very much. The first thing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
think about, on getting down to the handwork-room, is
setting to work, and going about everything quietly.
Everything in handwork, to be done nicely, must be neat,
clean, and carefully made and put together. In handwork
I have made an easel (which is a bit difficult to fix, unless
one has a proper hinge at the back) and a picture-frame
and a little doll's house, and I would like to make another
one, as I think it is so interesting planning out each little
corner for different things, and it helps one to think of how
they would plan out a home if they had one of their own,
as perhaps some of us will. I am now making a tram-car,
which is really very difficult. I have not nearly
finished yet, as there is such a great deal of work in it."</p>

<p>"Girls' likings for tools differ, but a file is the nicest tool, in my
eyes; it makes the rough places quite smooth and nice. In
my experience of handwork I have made a boat with the
captain's bridge and riggings, funnels, masts, and railings
around the edge. I have also made a picture frame and
doll's furniture for a friend's sister. At home I have made
a basement for a doll gentleman's house for the servants to
live in; I papered it and made it look neat and tidy."</p>

<p>"It is rather nice to see all of the girls making things at the
tables as busy as bees and it is nice to see their faces when
they look at the thing which they have just finished."</p>

<p>"The lesson I enjoy most during the week is the one termed
handwork, really carpentering on a small scale. There are
many things you can make, and if you take great pains with
them they become really pretty little ornaments; in fact, I
am thinking of having some shelves specially for my toys."</p>

<p>"When thinking of what measurements to make your toy and
planning it out in figures I think that it helps you greatly
in arithmetic. The hardest tool to use, I find, is the saw;
you have to have a steady hand to use it. When I first
took handwork lessons I used to think it hard work, but
now I think otherwise, and feel rather grand when I show
my parents the things I have made. The most important
use of handwork is that when you are older you can knock
a nail in or mend anything that needs mending in the
wooden line, instead of having to wait until father, brother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
or husband comes home tired for them to do it. As well
as this there might come a time when the making of toys
would help to earn the daily bread."</p>

<p>"I am making a tram-car now, and when I have finished it I
want to make a whole set of furniture for a doll's house.
The hardest part of it will be when I am putting legs on
tables or chairs. They have to be quite straight or the
table will not stand up."</p>

<p>"Sometimes we have just settled a post or a rail in the right
place with the help of some glue when somebody knocks
the table and over goes our piece of wood. Then we have
'to grin and bear it.'"</p>

<p>"Our teacher's name is Miss Polkinghorne, she being very
skilful and does much better work than us for we are only
miniatures yet awhile!"</p>

<p>"When I grow up handwork will be useful to me, for if anything
breaks I shall know how to mend it, and if I had
children I could make things to amuse them. Often I do
handwork at home. I like using the saw better than any
other tool. I have made a good many things, but I think
the best was a little toy motor-car. Handwork is my
favourite lesson; when I grow up I shall never leave off
doing handwork. My little sister helps me sometimes.
I think she will like it. My mother has asked me to make
a little thing to put match-boxes in."</p>

<p>"I think that it helps to make you very careful. For when one
is hammering and the hammer slips you get hurt and that
makes one careful. The hardest thing to do in a writing-case
is to saw the piece of wood for the ink division. It is
hard to get the exact size, but it does not look nice if it
does not fit exactly."</p>

<p>"I like handwork because it is different from any other lesson
in the week; there is not much writing to do, only to mark
on the wood certain lengths."</p>

<p>"I once spent a long time in doing a ship, but I could not get
on. I spent a very long time in trying to take the paper off
a tobacco box, but it was not going to come. I then went
on with the making, but it kept falling to pieces. I took it
home, and took necessary materials with it; paper for flags<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
and nails. I was a long time in doing it, as I took everything
apart and scratched all of the paper off; but it now
looks very much better. Handwork is rather a funny kind
of occupation for girls, but it teaches us how to do things."</p>

<p>"Handwork is one of the most interesting lessons that there is.
It helps one to have ideas, and also to be careful. The
reason why I like it is because I think that most people
should have a pastime and this is a very pleasant one, and
I think most children will agree to this point."</p>

<p>"I have to use many kinds of tools but the nicest is the hammer,
because when I use it I know I am near the end of a piece
of work. (It is not that I dislike handwork, but that I am
going to start something fresh.) I have already made two
picture-frames, two beds, a swing, a chair, a motor-car, an
easel, and I am now making another swing. I think I shall
try to make a baby's cot after I have finished my swing."</p>

<p>"I prefer to saw wood and stick pieces of wood together to
hammering nails in the wood, because the nails are sometimes
difficult to get in, for they very often go in crookedly.
When we get older and understand handwork more
thoroughly we may be able to make things for the home,
such as knife-boxes and paper-racks; the things we make
now are mostly pleasure toys that we will amuse our
younger brothers and sisters with. In most cases it needs
a great deal of patience, for the things, however simple, have
some difficult part."</p>

<p>"I like making toys, so then if you make them nicely you can
take them home for your little sisters and brothers to play
with. Handwork gives you ideas about things. We can
make very useful things such as letter-racks and pipe-racks.
I like making furniture for dolls' houses&mdash;chairs, tables, and
sofas. I like making swings. Some of us make animals."</p>

<p>"I do not know very much about handwork, as I have scarcely
handled a tool before I came here this term, but I think I
shall always enjoy it very much."</p>

<p>"I am making a doll's house now, for my little sister (aged five),
and I think it is teaching me to make myself useful, because
nobody at home cares for it much, so I will soon be able to
mend chairs, make brackets, etc., etc."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Since we have not been able to have proper firewood at home
lately, mother has had large wooden boxes to chop (a thing
I delight in doing), and now and again mother has given me
a few of them. I tried to make things out of them and
soon found it too rough: so father has given me some nice
polished wood, and he says that perhaps soon he will buy
me a nice little fret-saw set of tools as his are so large and
clumsy."</p>

<p>"I think I like sawing best of all, but I think I like all the rest
very well; I get quite excited when Thursday and Friday
come round (for those are the days on which we have handwork)."</p>

<p>"Mother thinks it is a splendid thing for girls, and I quite agree
with her. And we both think that it will help me on with
my geometry (which I'm not very brilliant in, but am
trying my best)."</p></blockquote>

<h2>TOY-MAKING IN SCHOOL AND
HOME</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />

TOY-MAKING AND ITS EDUCATIONAL
POSSIBILITIES</h3>


<p>One's main object in teaching children how to make toys should
be "to teach them how to make toys." Through their efforts
to make a beautiful toy they may become more patient, more
accurate, more observant, and more nimble with their fingers,
but these virtues will come more naturally and readily if the
teacher has but one object in view; singleness of purpose is the
secret of success.</p>

<p>Through classes in toy-making rightly conducted the children
become more resourceful, more quick at finding the right thing for
the right place, happier in some cases&mdash;that is to say, the so-called
dull child, the child that has no gift for mathematics, no memory
for languages, can often find in the handwork class the happiness
of doing something well, of producing a praiseworthy and pleasure-giving
piece of work.</p>

<p>It is very necessary to find occupation for backward children,
who sometimes drift rather aimlessly through the school, occupation
that will develop initiative and involve effort, occupation
that will bring disappointments (so often one careless bit of work
spoils an almost finished toy), but will also bring the joy of
successful achievement.</p>

<p>The ordinary lessons&mdash;English, French, etc.&mdash;may be said
also to bring their disappointments and joys, but not in
the same tangible way as the handwork lesson. The table
that will not stand steadily because all its legs have not been
carefully cut the right length teaches to a certain type of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
mind a more forcible lesson than the incorrect sum or French
exercise.</p>

<p>Again, it is very necessary that one lesson period a week should
be devoted to an occupation which is of the nature of a hobby;
the ordinary history and geography lessons do not often suggest
voluntary work for the children's leisure. Indeed, in many cases
it is easier to train children to become future clerks and teachers
than to train them how to use their leisure. Now handwork classes
suggest leisure occupations. The children who begin to make
their own toys in the lower forms for themselves, when older will
want to make them for other little children, when older, too, they
will begin to ask how to make useful articles&mdash;writing-cases,
medicine-chests, knife-boxes, soap-boxes&mdash;articles very frequently
suggested by their parents and much valued by them when
made.</p>

<p>One need scarcely fear for the future of the child, however dull
and mechanical her daily work as a grown-up person may be, if
she has abundant interests in life&mdash;if she can use and love to use
in leisure moments hammer, saw, and file, or if she has some other
healthy hobby. Still, for those who like the pleasant noise and
pleasant mess caused by tools, it is hard to find a happier occupation
than toy-making. A toy-maker becomes at once a collector
of useful odds and ends, and a collector (that is, one who collects
willingly the things he likes) is always a happy person; the toy-maker
becomes, too, the contriver, one who can adapt materials
to different purposes, and the giver&mdash;for the finished article must
be disposed of.</p>

<p>The mere acquisition of knowledge forms the least important
part of school work. A large number of facts in connexion with
history, geography, French, etc., have rightly to be learnt by
heart and are useful to the child in after life, but they do not bring
with them necessarily wisdom, nor does the learning of them play
such an important part in the child's development as the activity
of the child in the handwork class does. Some one has wisely said,
"If education at school means nothing more to the children than
a respectable routine and a few examinations successfully circumvented,
then education is a failure; if <i>besides that</i>, it has enlivened
the years and counted for something in the general joy of growing,
then it has a real value&mdash;a value which entitles it to a place among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
happy memories, perhaps even the highest place of all." Many
of us perhaps feel in looking back on our schooldays how many
good things we lost for the sake of learning some now forgotten
facts; how many good things we lost to be first in class; we confused
means with ends, we toiled over our history and learnt it to
get full marks in the coming test (we should have toiled over our
toy for love of making it and to produce as perfect a one as possible);
in after life we would gladly tread some of the by-paths of knowledge,
have some hobby, but our rigorous system of training left
us no opportunity in young days, and sapped the energy that
alone would make it possible in after years.</p>

<p>No scheme of work then for schooldays must be so rigorous that
it leaves no leisure for 'feast days.' Some days, some hours must
come back to memory, bringing not only their past happiness, but
ideas for present occupation. The happiest days of youth are
generally the busiest, days when one had something one really
wanted to be busy about for its own sake, not for the sake of
marks or for the sake of outstripping one's fellow-pupils, or
for the sake of one's future. These busy, happy, idle days
are the feast days of youth, days one thinks of as the poet
thought when he wrote:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And none will know the gleam there used to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the feast days freshly kept by me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But men will call the golden hour of bliss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'About this time,' or 'shortly after this.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This book on toy-making is not written to advocate the so-called
'primrose path in education,' the 'turn-work-into-play
theory,' though undoubtedly the first chapters at least of this
book will be attacked by those who fear that education is yielding
or is going to yield to a popular clamour for ease.</p>

<p>For these people, too, Masefield has a message:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Best trust the happy moments. What they gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes man less fearful of the certain grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gives his work compassion and new eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The days that make us happy make us wise.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Moreover, every teacher of handwork knows how little ease the
busy children in her classes get&mdash;in these classes they are never
passive listeners or passive learners by heart. They see the need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
of accuracy, the labour necessary to produce it, they suffer for
every mistake they make, they realise some of the joy and pain
of creating, and, best of all perhaps, they realise the joy of work&mdash;active,
muscular work as distinguished from their ordinary
scholarly work.</p>

<p>With regard to the question of work it has been ably said that
"No one has yet preached in an adequate way the gospel of work&mdash;real
hard work&mdash;as the most amusing of all occupations&mdash;not a
noble duty."</p>

<p>It is somewhat unfortunate that directly one begins to like
one's work one is accused of playing.</p>

<p>To return to toy-making (which is work or play, according to
whether one dislikes or likes it)&mdash;whether toy-making be taken
in the school or not, the teachers will find it a useful hobby.
Through it they can amuse themselves and renew their youth;
through it they will have an enduring bond of union with their
children.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of history and geography often fails to impress
our children; they probably think we are a little foolish to burden
our heads with so many facts that seem to have no bearing on
to-day; but when we can use our hands and make a toy they see
us with other eyes, we are really clever people worth cultivating.</p>

<p>If toy-making be taken as a form of handwork in school, one
enlists at once the interest of the parent&mdash;especially of the father&mdash;the
mother sometimes, not often, objects to the mess. This
interest of the parents is a great gain; the father delights in doing
a bit of the work&mdash;sticking on the difficult funnel, sawing the hard
piece of wood; child learns from parent, and parent from child,
and in this way the father may again remember half-forgotten
ambitions, half-neglected talents, and find in toy-making a profitable
occupation, profitable mainly in the fact that any occupation
which recalls to the grown-up person his youth, with its fresher
outlook on life, must be wholesome.</p>

<p>Finally, if the handwork classes make the children more 'at
home' with themselves and with life, they will have done something;
if they help them toward self-realisation they will help
them toward the joy the writer speaks of who says, "Joy of life
seems to me to arise from a sense of being where one belongs, as I
feel right here; of being four-square with the life we have chosen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
All the discontented people I know are trying sedulously to be
something they are not, to do something they cannot do.... It is
curious, is it not, with what skill we will adapt our sandy land to
potatoes and grow our beans with clay, and with how little wisdom
we farm the soil of our own natures?"</p>

GENERAL PRINCIPLES; MATERIALS</h3>


<p>In toy-making in schools it is very necessary to design toys that
can be made from materials which are easily obtained. The
Board of Education in a report on handwork in the London
elementary schools says: "The range of materials used is limited,
as a rule, to paper, cardboard, clay, and 'prepared wood' or 'stripwood.'
It is perhaps unfortunate that these are almost entirely
'school materials,' in other words materials which are not likely
to be much used outside the school, either in the child's home or
in after life."</p>

<p>There is truth in this&mdash;to give the child too much 'prepared
material' tends to make him less inventive, resourceful, and painstaking,
and prevents him from continuing his work at home,
where he has not got prepared material. Any series of toys made
from the same material&mdash;say a series of toys made from match
stales or from 'stripwood'&mdash;has very limited educational advantages.
Toys made from a combination of waste materials are
the best&mdash;match-boxes, cardboard and wooden boxes of all sizes,
mantle-boxes, reels, corks, broom-handles, silver paper, etc., can
all play a part in producing an effective, even a beautiful toy.
Most of the toys described in this book are made from so-called
'waste materials.'</p>

<p>With regard to infant school work, squares of white paper&mdash;cartridge
paper or ordinary exercise paper&mdash;which the children
can colour themselves are better than a too slavish use of the
coloured gummed squares supplied to schools. Further directions
with regard to materials will be given in connexion with the
various toys. It is advisable to use as few tools as possible, both
because the fewer tools the less expense and because the fewer tools
the more thought and ingenuity required. To have a perfect
instrument at hand for every need paralyses work, thought, and
happiness. Most of the toys in this book are made&mdash;if for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
little ones, with scissors, if for older ones, with hammer, saw,
and file.</p>

<p>A graduated course is necessary. Generally speaking, the little
ones from five to seven make their toys of paper, clay, plasticine,
and raffia. Children from seven to ten can make simple wooden
toys. Wooden toys are the best; many things can be done with
wood, impossible with cardboard or paper, and they are so lasting.</p>

<p>Cardboard modelling is always difficult, and as a rule should not
be attempted by children younger than nine. Except that they
provide practice in accurate measurement, toys made of paper
and cardboard by children of nine or older are disappointing, they
crush so quickly. Quite strong toys can, however, be made from
a combination of wood, cardboard, and paper.</p>

<p>If really strong paper toys are required (for example, the various
articles of doll's furniture, the table and chair, etc., are more
valuable if strongly made), an excellent medium can be made by
pasting (using ordinary flour paste) two or three sheets of paper
together and allowing them to dry thoroughly under pressure.
Both or all three sheets must be pasted over before they are
brought together to avoid subsequent curling. This will, however,
prove too stiff a medium for children younger than
five.</p>

<p><b>Skewers</b> will be found very useful in toy-making. Any ordinary
metal skewer is useful for boring holes in cardboard and corks,
while the short meat skewers, three inches long (cost twopence per
dozen), are an excellent substitute for bradawls when the children
are making the early light woodwork models; later on in woodwork
a fine workman's bradawl is required, or a drill.</p>

<p>Wooden skewers are useful for axles of all kinds.</p>

<p>Another useful boring tool (for making holes in paper, corks, or
cardboard) is the metal pin stopper supplied with tubes of seccotine.
This bores a hole in cardboard or paper that is the right size
for a match. When boring holes in cardboard the children will
find a cotton reel useful to bore upon; their meat skewer or seccotine
pin stopper can then pass through the cardboard into the
hole in the reel.</p>

<p><b>Methods of joining Cardboard and Paper Edges.</b> (1) Leaving
a flange. In Fig. 1 the shaded portions represent flanges&mdash;flange
<span class="smcap">A</span> is for joining side of house <span class="smcap">B</span> to <span class="smcap">C</span>, flanges <span class="smcap">D</span>, <span class="smcap">E</span>, <span class="smcap">F</span>, <span class="smcap">G<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></span>
are for holding the roof; they must, of course, be bent at right
angles to the sides <span class="smcap">B</span> and <span class="smcap">H</span>. (Note flange in socket of candlestick,
Fig. 49, Chapter IV, and in pigeon-house, Chapter X.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_032a.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1</span></div>
</div>

<p>If Fig. 1 is made of cardboard, flange A must have the surface
of the cardboard pared away, otherwise the joining will be clumsy.
The dotted lines represent bends only in the
case of paper, but half cuts in the case of
cardboard.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_032b.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2</span></div>
</div>

<p>With regard to the size of the flange, this
will depend upon the strength of the adhesive
used and the stiffness of the material. Generally
speaking, the larger the flange the better,
for a narrow flange tends to turn up and must
be held down longer than a wide one.</p>

<p>A good general rule to remember when joining two pieces of
material is this&mdash;that
it is always the
thinner of the two
that is to be pasted
or glued. This must
be borne in mind
when using the second
method of joining
cardboard or paper
edges.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_032c3a.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3</span><i>a</i></div>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3</span><i>b</i></div>
</div>

<p>(2) Using paper
hinges. The hinge
should extend the
whole length of the edges that come together, as in Fig. 2,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
where pieces of cardboard <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span> are joined by the hinge
<i>a b c d e f</i>. Before pasting the hinge must be folded along <i>b e</i>,
care being taken that <i>b e</i> is at right angles to <i>a c</i> and <i>d f</i>.</p>

<p>The sides, bottom, and roof of the Noah's Ark are joined
together by paper hinges (Chapter X).</p>

<p>(3) Wherever it is necessary to join curved edges, the flange
must be cut as in Fig. 3<i>a</i>, flange <i>a b c d</i>. Fig. 3<i>b</i> shows paper
curved and flanges bent down ready for pasting.</p>

<p>This is the method used for fastening on paper funnels, the
bottom of the paper mug (Fig. 57, Chapter IV), etc.</p>

<p><b>The Making and Fixing of Wheels.</b> If it is desired to attach
movable wheels to any of the toys described in the following
chapters (in the early chapters for greater simplicity the wheels
are gummed to sides of carts, or to matches, etc.), the following
methods are suggested.</p>

<p>(1) The wheels can be rigidly fixed to the axle&mdash;that is, a
match end is pushed tight into the cardboard wheel and the
axle is free to turn in loose bearings, as in Fig. 4, fixed under the
cart or other vehicle or to the sides. These bearings can be cut
from cardboard or cartridge paper.</p>

<p>In Fig. 4 the paper is bent at a right angle along the dotted
line, and the rectangular portion is gummed under the cart. If
the rectangular portion is gummed to
the side of the cart no bend is needed.
The parts of the match sticks that
pass through the holes must be
rounded with sand-paper so that
they will turn easily in the holes.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_033.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4</span></div>
</div>

<p>(2) The axle can be glued to
the bottom of the cart and the wheels left free to revolve.
The wheels are kept in their places by the following plan. Cut
some small cardboard washers, seccotine one near each end of the
axle as in Fig. 5<i>a</i>, taking care that they do not come under
the cart. Slip on the wheels, taking care that the centre hole is
punched large enough to allow the wheel to revolve freely. This
will be the case if a steel meat skewer (size about 7 inches long)
has been used to make the holes. Fix washers outside the wheels
to keep them on, as in Fig. 5<i>b</i>. These washers keep the wheels
from sagging.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>These wheels will revolve if the match stick has been rounded
with sand-paper.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 266px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5</span><i>a</i></div>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5</span><i>b</i></div>
</div>

<p>With regard to the arrangement of the toys in this book,
roughly they are described in order of difficulty, but for convenience
sometimes this order
has been departed from. For
example, match-box toys have
been grouped together, cork
animals, etc. The teacher must
select her own models from
different parts of the book and
use them in accordance with her
children's ability and her own
taste.</p>

<p>Another important principle
to follow is this. The teacher should give as few directions
as possible, be as silent as it is possible for a teacher to be.
The child has an excellent opportunity in these classes of learning
from his own mistakes. This opportunity must not be
taken from him; he must be given the chance of finding out
his own mistakes. Moreover, every difficulty should not be
anticipated for the child; nor should too many warnings be
given. Let the children set to work as soon as possible and use
their tools without too many instructions about them. Let them
ask, let them have the pleasure of discovering; every child wants
to learn, but not every child wants to be taught.</p>

<p>All models should be made as large as is reasonably possible;
this should be insisted on from the beginning. Lastly, great
accuracy (though much to be desired) must not be expected from
the child; careful work must be insisted on, but one must learn
to recognise the careful work of a child (which is so different from
that of the grown-up person) and not heedlessly blame him or her
for not reaching perfection.</p>

<p>Accuracy is so often the outcome of 'lack of vision.' The
child so often has that 'vision,' that imaginative outlook on life
that floods the mind with ideas, but lacks accurate power of expression,
while the grown-up person has the accurate power of expression,
but has lost the fresh imagination of youth and all its ideals.
We must see to it that we do not dim our children's vision.</p>

PAPER WORK FOR INFANTS</h3>


<p><b>Materials.</b> White paper of any kind that is not too thick and
bends easily, <i>e.g.</i> cartridge paper, plain white foolscap, pages from
exercise books. Pieces of coloured paper are introduced into some
of the toys. It is better, however, to encourage the children to
colour the white paper with chalks. One must remember, however,
children's delight in coloured paper and let them have it
sometimes. A wall-paper sample book will provide coloured
paper, and gummed coloured squares are supplied to most schools.
These gummed squares are really too thin for effective toy-making,
and there is the temptation to the child to lick them when making
models from them.</p>

<p><b>Adhesives.</b> In many cases the toys can be fastened together
by means of paper-fasteners. Where this is not possible the
following adhesives are recommended. (1) Gloy&mdash;this is clean
and fastens the paper fairly securely. (2) Higgins' Vegetable
Glue. This has one great advantage over Gloy: it cannot be
spilt. A little of it can be put on a piece of paper for each child;
this is a great convenience in a large class. (3) Home-made paste
of flour and water; this is very clean and wholesome.</p>


<p class="ph4">PAPER TOYS FROM THE SQUARE</p>

<p>The following toys should be made as <i>large</i> as possible, never
from a square of less than 4 inches each side. The larger the toy
the thicker the paper that can be used and the stronger it is. In
the following diagrams, lines to be cut are drawn, lines to be
folded are dotted, parts to be cut off are shaded.</p>

<p>As soon as possible the child should be shown how to make a
large brown paper envelope to keep his work in.</p>

<p>Model 1. <b>The Rabbit Hutch.</b> Fold paper into 16 squares
as in Fig. 6. Cut lines indicated. Draw bars in square <span class="smcap">A</span>, or fold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
along <span class="smcap">T S</span> (Fig. 7) and cut out the bars; the door is drawn and cut in
square <span class="smcap"><b>b</b></span>. Colour the whole
yellow or brown to represent
wood. Gum <span class="smcap">L</span> over <span class="smcap">M</span>; <span class="smcap">N</span> over
<span class="smcap">M</span>; <span class="smcap">O</span> over <span class="smcap">N</span>. The same on
the other side. A small paper-fastener
makes a good handle.
Rabbits and carrots can be
cut out of paper to furnish
the hutch (Fig. 7).</p>

<p>From a similar square
folded into sixteen squares
a <b>Railway Carriage</b> can be
made. In this case the door
is cut in the middle of <span class="smcap">C D</span>
(Fig. 8). Windows and panels are drawn on the paper. A roll of
paper is put on top for the light,
or a small piece of cork can be
used. The wheels are drawn
by means of halfpennies, then
folded in half; one half is pasted
under the carriage, the other
appears as in Fig. 8. Three or
four carriages can be made and
fastened by strips of paper.</p>

<p>Children delight in chalking the blinds of their carriages in
various colours and labelling
them 1st, 2nd, or 3rd Class.
The top of the carriage
should be darkened with
pencil or chalk, or a piece
of black paper pasted over
it.</p>

<span class="smcap">E F</span> (Fig. 6) and gumming <span class="smcap">L</span> over <span class="smcap">N</span> and <span class="smcap">M</span> over <span class="smcap">L</span>.</p>

<p>The <b>Basket</b> (Fig. 10) is a simple model. One quarter of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
square is cut off to form a handle. Cut remaining portion as in
Fig. 11, double over corners <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, paste corner <i>d</i> over
<span class="smcap">D</span>, <i>c</i> over <span class="smcap">C</span>, <i>b</i> over <span class="smcap">B</span>, <i>a</i> over <span class="smcap">A</span>.</p>

<p>Paper fruit, apples and oranges, can be cut out to go in
the basket.</p>

<p><b>A Wardrobe.</b> Fold square into sixteen parts and cut as in
Fig. 12. Gum <span class="smcap">A</span> over <span class="smcap">C</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span> over <span class="smcap">A</span>. Repeat with <span class="smcap">D E F</span>.
Gum a piece of silver paper on the door for a mirror; square
<span class="smcap">H</span>, with its corners cut off, forms ornament on top (Fig. 13). A
match is gummed inside, on which clothes are hung. The
children can either draw these
and cut them out, or cut them
out from old fashion plates.</p>

and colour light brown (Fig. 14).
By cutting off the lid and
making a handle from it a
basket can be made. The
children themselves may be
able to suggest some of these articles and should be encouraged
to.</p>

<p><b>A Sedan Chair</b> can be made in the same way as the wardrobe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
(see Fig. 12). Loops of paper are gummed on at <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span> (Fig. 15),
through which the shafts pass; a window can be cut by folding
the door <span class="smcap">C D G H</span> in half along <span class="smcap">K L</span>. A piece of coloured paper can
be gummed inside the window for a blind; some sort of ornament
can be gummed at the top along <span class="smcap">C D</span> and <span class="smcap">E F</span>. Panels, etc., can
be drawn.</p>

<p>To make a <b>Chair</b> to go with the table. Take a double square
the same size as that used for legs of table. Fold into eight as in
Fig. 24. Cut in half along <i>a b</i>. Squares <span class="smcap">A</span>, <span class="smcap">B</span>, <span class="smcap">C</span> form front legs,
seat and back of chair respectively. Square <span class="smcap">F</span> is gummed to <span class="smcap">B</span>, so
that <span class="smcap">E</span> forms back legs. The chair must be strengthened by gumming
<span class="smcap">H</span> to <span class="smcap">C</span> and <span class="smcap">G</span> to <span class="smcap">E</span>. Coloured squares can be gummed to seat
and back; the rest of the chair can be chalked to represent wood

MATCH-BOX TOYS</h3>


<p>Many simple and effective toys can be made from match-boxes.
The great advantage of these toys is that the children
can readily supply the materials themselves. In every case
the toys explained here have been made by young children,
whose ages vary from four to seven. The materials used are
match-boxes, matches, paper of different kinds, white, brown,
coloured, and cardboard, while in some toys corks and silver paper
have been introduced. For sticking paper on to the boxes, gloy
or vegetable glue is suitable, but when matches have to be fastened
into or on to the boxes it is best to use liquid glue or seccotine.
Some of the toys can be made more effective by colouring them
with crayons.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 75</span></div>
</div>

<p><b>A Canoe.</b> To make the canoe (Fig. 74) the inside portion of
the match-box is gummed to a piece of stiff paper or cardboard
pointed at each end. Strips of paper gummed to the sides of
the box form the seats. The paddle (Fig. 75) is made of a
match, to the ends of which paper discs are gummed. To get
these circles the children can use farthings and draw round them.
The paddle and the seats can be
coloured with brown crayons.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 266px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 76</span></div>
</div>

<p><b>A Kayak.</b> For the kayak (Fig.
76) a piece of paper is measured
to fit over the box; it is doubled in half and a small hole cut
in it, then gummed to the sides of the box.</p>

<p><b>A Motor-car</b> (Fig. 77). The car consists of a match-box
without the cover. The seats are of white paper. The following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
them measure and cut a piece of paper, <span class="smcap">A B C D</span>, that will just cover
the box from side to side, making bends <i>a c</i> and <i>b d</i> where the
edges of the box come. Fold paper into four as in Fig. 78. Cut
along <i>e f</i>, and cut off the shaded portions and
fold as in Fig. 79. Gum the parts <span class="smcap">G</span> and <span class="smcap">M</span> to the
side of the box.</p>

<p>Wheels for all match-box toys are made from
stiff paper or cardboard, the circle being drawn
from a farthing, or, where larger wheels are
necessary, from a halfpenny. The spokes are drawn on the
wheels. These can either be gummed to the sides of the
match-box, or, if holes are made in the wheels, they can be fastened
to each end of a match, which is then glued to the bottom of the
box.</p>

<p><b>A House or Barn.</b> From the covers that are left, after
making the canoe and the motor-car, a house or barn can be
made (Fig. 80). One cover is cut open and the top bent back
as in Fig. 81. A portion of the second cover is cut off (Fig. 82).</p>

<p>Side <span class="smcap">A</span> is then gummed to <span class="smcap">B</span>, and <span class="smcap">C D</span> is fastened to <span class="smcap">E F</span> by
means of a piece of folded paper covering the whole of the roof.
This paper is double the size of <span class="smcap">C D H G</span> (Fig. 82), is coloured
grey or blue to represent slates, and folded along the middle.</p>

<p><b>A Sentry-box.</b> This is an easy toy to make. The children
will notice that one end of a match-box is
double&mdash;that is, one piece of wood overlaps
the other. If they unfasten these and bend
them out they form the roof of the sentry
box (Fig. 83). A piece of paper can be pasted
behind to fill up the hollow. The toy looks
more effective if covered entirely with brown
paper. A soldier can be
cut out of paper, coloured
and gummed to the
bottom of the box.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 84</span></div>
</div>

<p><b>A Castle.</b> A castle
can be made from the
cover. A piece of paper is cut to fit
round it, doors and windows are marked
on it with pencil or crayon, and one
edge is cut to represent battlements
(Fig. 84). The flagstaff is a match
glued inside. A larger castle can be made
by fastening two or more covers together.</p>

<p><b>A Jack-in-the-box.</b> These toys are so simple that the
diagrams almost explain themselves. In the case of the Jack-in-the-box
the children like to decorate the half-opened match-box
with coloured paper. The little figure is made of bits of wool, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
piece of cotton is tied round the neck and put through a hole in
the top, a match is tied to the cotton to prevent it slipping back;
another piece of cotton tied to the waist of the doll pulls it down
(Fig. 85).</p>

<p><b>A Belfry.</b> In the belfry the back of the box at <span class="smcap">A</span> has been
cut out, the bell is made of paper or cardboard, covered with
silver paper (Fig. 86). A match stick is passed through a hole in
the bell, and gummed to each side of the box. Another match is
gummed to the bell, and a piece of cotton attached for ringing.</p>

wheels are the same size. Two
are fastened to a match for
the axle, which is then glued
underneath the box; the third
wheel is glued between two
matches, which are fastened
underneath the box. In Fig. 89
the side wheels are larger and a cardboard set of shafts is made for
the small front wheel.</p>

<p>Fig. 90 shows the shape of these shafts. The shaded portion
is bent at right angles to the shaft and glued under
the box. The small wheel
can be gummed between
these shafts, or, if the
shafts are fastened on with
a space between them, and
holes made in each end, a
piece of match stick, on
which the small wheel is
mounted, can be passed through the holes. A match is glued
across the back of the box (Fig. 88) to form the bar by means of
which the cart is pushed along.</p>

<p><b>A Tram-car</b> (Fig. 99). For this toy two insides of match-boxes
are needed. The children could cut and gum to one box a
piece of cardboard <span class="smcap">A B</span>. Then into this box are gummed six
matches of the same length. While these are drying the wheels can
be made and the top prepared. The top
is a box turned over with a piece of
paper gummed round the edge. The
paper should be coloured yellow. The
projecting paper forms the rail round
the top of the car. When the matches
are quite firm the inverted box is placed
over them.</p>

<p><b>A Match-box Train</b> (Fig. 101). The engine is a match-box
turned upside down, to which is gummed a cork covered with red
or green paper. The broad end of the cork has been sand-papered
to make it more equal to the other end. The funnel is a piece of
cardboard blackened and inserted into a slit in the cork. Half a
match-box glued to the cork forms the cab. The coal tender is
a match-box on wheels; a piece of brown paper can be pasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
round one end to form the back and the sides. The simplest way
of making a carriage is to fold a piece of paper into three, mark on
it the door and the windows and gum it to the inside of the box.
For this piece of paper the children can get the measurements
from the match-box.</p>

The waiting-room or shelter is a match-box gummed to platform
as in diagram, with a triangular piece of paper pasted behind to
form a roof. A seat can be pasted inside. The name of the station,
signals, and a signal-box (a half-opened match-box standing on

of brown paper are needed. The brown paper should be in length
one and a half times the length of the match-box and broad enough
to wrap round a match-box and cover every side except one
narrow side. Fold the paper in two along <span class="smcap">C B</span>. Draw the runners
on the doubled paper and cut out as in Fig. 133. Cut the straps
<span class="smcap">E O</span> and <span class="smcap">G P</span> along the top <span class="smcap">K F</span> and <span class="smcap">L H</span>; double them along <span class="smcap">M</span> and <span class="smcap">N</span>.

same on the other side; pieces <span class="smcap">M K F</span>, etc., may be cut shorter for
convenience in gumming. A piece of brown paper forms the back,
<span class="smcap">D</span> (Fig. 132). Finally, a piece of paper just the size of the match-box
can be pasted over <span class="smcap">A</span> to make the sledge look tidy.</p>

<p><b>Cork Boats.</b> Besides the submarine described in Chapter VI,
many other boats can be made from corks, all of which will float
well. The corks are joined together by pieces of wire passing
through the middle. For the keel cut a narrow strip of lead (not
more than &frac14; inch wide); point both ends, bend them up at right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
angles as in Fig. 150; make slits in the corks and push in the
pointed ends of the lead. The keel is made more secure by driving
pins or thin nails through the lead and the corks. The keel also
helps to hold the corks firmly together and prevents them from
slipping round on the connecting wire.</p>

<p><b>A Steamer</b> (Fig. 151). Select three corks, as uniform in size
as possible. Cut and file part of their round surface quite flat
as in Fig. 152. Shape the bow and stern. The funnels are made
of two small corks, fastened by pins. The masts consist of pieces
of cane or thin sticks.</p>

<p><b>A Sailing-boat.</b> A very pretty little sailing-boat can be
made, as in Fig. 153. The sails are of glazed lining. The
edges of this do not fray, so the sails do not require hemming,
and as they must be as light as possible, this is a great
advantage.</p>

<p>The gaff, <span class="smcap">A</span>, is tied with thread to the mast, also the boom, <span class="smcap">B</span>;
both are pieces of cane, to which the mainsail, <span class="smcap">D</span>, is sewn. The
end of the boom is tied by cotton to a piece of wire at the
stern, shaped as in Fig. 154. Care must be taken that the
lead keel is exactly in the middle, and that the sails and masts
are not too heavy, otherwise the boat will blow over on its
side.</p>

<p><b>A Paddle-boat.</b> Two pieces of cork pinned on each side of
the steamer and cut as in Fig. 155, or even left round, make
very realistic-looking paddle wheels. Other models, such as a
dreadnought, a fishing smack, etc., are easily made.</p>

speed. Bow and stern are equally sharp pointed. One side of
the proa is flat, and in a straight line from bow to stern (Fig. 157),
but the other is rounded as in other vessels. The outrigger
prevents the boat from turning over.</p>

<p><b>Cork Wrestlers</b> (Fig. 165). This is a very amusing toy and is
very easily made. Cut and file two corks to the shape shown in
<b>Fig. 161</b>. Drill a hole through the shoulders (<i>a a</i>) and hips (<i>b b</i>),
and flatten these for the limbs
to work against. The arms
and legs are made of cardboard.
Cut out the legs as in
<b>Fig. 162</b> and make holes in
them. Pass a piece of stout
wire through the hips and the
holes in the legs and double
the ends over, so that the legs
will not slip off, but let them
be loose enough to move freely.</p>

<p>In shaping the legs make
them bend slightly at the knee,
as this makes the figures more
life-like in their movements.</p>

<p>The arms must be cut out
in pairs as in <b>Fig. 163</b>. Make holes near the shoulders and one
at <i>c</i>. Then fasten the arms to the body in the same way as
the legs.</p>

<p>The heads are made of cork, the eyes, mouth, etc., being
marked in ink. Cut a slit across the neck and one across the top
of the body. Fasten the head to the body by inserting, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
help of a pen-knife, a strip of calico into both these slits, so that the
head is fairly close to the body (Fig. 164). The heads will move

wrestle. Paint the legs
and arms.</p>

<p>Similar little wrestlers (Fig. 167) can be made from two wooden
clothes-pegs (Fig. 166). Cut the pegs in two along the dotted line.
The upper part forms the
head and body of a
wrestler, and the lower
parts are used for the
legs. Drill holes through
the bodies (at A in Fig.
166) and through the legs
at the thin ends; fasten
these to the body with
wire.</p>

<p>For the arms two
pieces of thin, flat wood
are necessary, about 3
inches in length. Bore
holes at each end and in the middle, shape them roughly
with a pen-knife to represent the joined hands of the wrestlers.
Fix these pieces to the bodies and work them as described in the
case of the cork wrestlers.</p>

<p><b>The Viking Ship</b> (Fig. 170). Give the children oblong pieces
of cardboard, <span class="smcap">A B C D</span>, about 8&frac12; inches by 2&frac12; inches. A line, <span class="smcap">E F</span>,
drawn across the middle of the cardboard gives the top of the ship.
The ship is then drawn on the cardboard, and the shaded part
of the cardboard is cut away. Dragons' or serpents' heads are
drawn on paper, cut out and gummed on to the stern and prow
(as <span class="smcap">G</span> and <span class="smcap">H</span>); a tongue cut from red paper can be added to each
dragon. (The 'dragon ships' were, as a rule, the largest, the
'serpent ships' being smaller and better adapted to sailing.)
The mast is cut out of cardboard and gummed behind the ship;
the sail is cut out of paper and gummed to the mast. The shields
are cut out of cardboard and pasted along the sides. The ship
may be painted white, blue, red, or any combination of colours;
the warriors' shields were also of different colours. The sails were
generally in coloured stripes, blue and white or red and white.
Masts brown. For teachers who want to be historically accurate
the following notes on the viking ship may be useful.</p>

<p>The viking ship (from ninth century on-wards) was clincher-built,
caulked with hair, and iron fastened. One ship we know to
have been 78 feet long by 15&frac12; feet of extreme breadth; the ships
varied in length from 50 to 150 feet. They had from twelve to
thirty-five seats for rowers. Generally both ends of the vessel were
alike, so that it could be steered from either end by the paddle,
which was used everywhere until the invention of the rudder.</p>

<p>Standards and pennants were used, and possibly the two-armed
iron anchor (for the Romans used it), so the children can cut out
pennants and anchors for their ships.</p>

<p>Children delight in naming their ships and should be given
some of the 'real' old names to choose from. These old names
generally referred to the figure-head, which was of wood or metal,
in the shape of the head of a dragon, deer, bird or other animal&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>
<i>Dragon</i>, <i>Serpent</i>, <i>Raven</i>, <i>Deer of the Surf</i>, <i>Sea-king's Deer</i>,
<i>Horse of the Sea</i>, <i>Sea-bird</i>, etc. To
support the boat two pieces of cardboard
are cut and folded, as <span class="smcap">N P O Q</span>
(Fig. 171). The cardboard must be
half cut with a pen-knife along the
line <span class="smcap">R S</span>, so that it can be bent easily.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_095.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 171</span></div>
</div>

<p>The portion <span class="smcap">N R P S</span> is gummed to the back of the ship, <span class="smcap">R S O Q</span>
bent at right angles to <span class="smcap">N P R S</span> forms the support, with corner <span class="smcap">S T Q</span>
cut off, so that the ship tilts a little backward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p><b>A Ph[oe]nician Warship</b>, 480 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> (Fig. 172). This is made, as
the viking ship, from oblong <span class="smcap">A B C D</span>; pieces of paper, <span class="smcap">E</span> and <span class="smcap">F</span>,
with railings drawn on them, are gummed on each end; a stern
ornament, <span class="smcap">G</span>, is cut out of paper and gummed at one end.
(When a vessel was captured in olden days this was kept as a
trophy.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_096.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 172</span></div>
</div>

<p>Small circles are drawn along the side of the ship to represent
the holes for the oars, or holes may be made in the cardboard
and matches or strips of cardboard passed through for oars.</p>

<p>A device of the sun (common to Carthaginian vessels) should be
drawn on the sail and prow. The ship can be coloured in stripes
yellow and red, with one blue band near the top; stern ornament
red and yellow; sail yellow with red sun.</p>

<p>The ships represented in Fig. 173 and in Plate IV are made in
the same way. In all these a piece of cardboard forms the foundation.
Masts, high funnels, anything likely to bend, should also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
be cut from cardboard, but sails, stern or prow ornaments, railings,
flags, etc., are best cut out of paper. By means of a needle and
cotton, rigging can be added to the ships.</p>

</div>

<p><b>A Tudor Ship</b> (Fig. 173). Tudor ships are difficult, because of
their elaborate and lofty forecastle and poops. A simplified one
is shown in the figure. This can be easily managed by the children
if an oblong <span class="smcap">A B C D</span> is given them, divided into six parts lengthways,
or if the oblong <span class="smcap">E B F D</span> is given them. In the latter case
the poop and forecastle are cut out of paper and gummed on
separately. The ship is coloured red, yellow and blue, the sails
white. The ship may be decorated with many flags.</p>

<p>The <b>Cunarder</b> has red funnels, with a black band at the top
and two black lines underneath.</p>

<p>The <b>Super-Dreadnought</b> should be coloured dark grey.
Children will delight to make, in a similar way, a Roman galley,
Columbus' <i>Santa Maria</i>, in which he discovered America, the
<i>Black Prince</i>, in which Sir Philip Sidney's body was carried to
England, Britain's first <b>Ironclad</b>, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of cardboard supports pieces of wood (about &frac14; inch
thick, 1 inch wide, the length equal to that of the ship) can be half
sawn through along the middle line and the ship inserted in this
slit; or pieces of wood (cubes) may be glued to the back. In the
first case the surface of the wood should be painted blue to
represent water.</p>

CARDBOARD AND PAPER TOYS INVOLVING USE
OF RULER, SET-SQUARE, SCISSORS, AND KNIFE</h3>


<p><b>Materials.</b> The cardboard used should not be too thick; medium
thickness is best (threepence a sheet). Almost any paper that is
not too thin can be used for making hinges. All kinds of cardboard
boxes will be found of great use in making shops, engines, etc.</p>

<p><b>Tools.</b> <i>Scissors</i> with round points are safer for children to
use, though perhaps not quite so suitable for the work.</p>

<p><i>Knives.</i> For little children the carton knife, consisting of a
small blade projecting not more than a quarter of an inch from the
handle, is the best, as the smallness of the blade does much to
prevent the children cutting their fingers.</p>

<p>For older children the "London" or "Leipsic" pattern is
suitable, or they can use their pen-knives. These can be sharpened
quite well on an ordinary knifeboard.</p>

<p><i>Rulers.</i> The "non-slip" safety ruler is the best. It grips
the paper well, and the depression between the raised edges
enables the children to hold it steady when cutting.</p>

<p><b>Adhesives.</b> Higgins' vegetable glue or seccotine.</p>

<p><b>A Pigeon-house</b> (Fig. 178). On a piece of cartridge paper
draw an oblong 8 inches by 2 inches, and divide it into four
squares (Fig. 174). On the top of each construct an equilateral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
triangle. Make a flange about &frac14; inch on the sides of the triangles,
as shown in Fig. 174, and on the sides of
the squares. Cut and fold back the doorways.
Fold and gum together. Flanges 1, 2, 3, 4
should be folded in. Draw and cut out a
square, side 2&frac12; inches (Fig. 175); gum the
house on to this.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 266px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 175</span></div>

<p>For the post draw an oblong 8 inches by
2&frac12; inches (Fig. 177). Fold into five lengths
(&frac12; inch wide). Draw <span class="smcap">J K</span> and <span class="smcap">L M</span> &frac12; inch from
the ends of oblong <span class="smcap">E F G H</span>. Cut along the
lines, cut off the shaded portions, and fold
along the dotted lines. Gum the two outer
portions over each other to make a four-sided
post.</p>

<p>For the base cut a square, the side 3 inches
(Fig. 176), and to this gum the flanges at <span class="smcap">L M</span>. Gum the
house to the flanges at <span class="smcap">J K</span>. To make the top stronger, a
second square (the side 2&frac12; inches) can be cut; the flanges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
at <span class="smcap">L</span> <span class="smcap">M</span> are gummed to this, and then the house is
fastened on.</p>

<p>Other easily made farmhouse models are a hen-coop, a barn,
a pigsty, the farmhouse itself, etc.</p>

<p><b>The Noah's Ark</b> (Plate III). As this is a fairly large toy, it is
best made from separate pieces of cardboard hinged together by
strips of paper. If it is cut from one or two pieces, the size of the
cardboard is somewhat unmanageable.</p>

<p>The following Noah's Ark is of a suitable size for holding cork
animals.</p>

<p>Two pieces of cardboard are cut, 8&frac12; inches by 4 inches (Fig.
179). Cut two other pieces, 3&frac12; inches by 6 inches. Mark and
cut these out as <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">C</span>. In one side, <span class="smcap">A</span>, a door is cut. A
paper-fastener is put in to form the handle. On the other sides
windows may be drawn and coloured. When fastening the pieces
together the children must be very careful that the bend of the
hinge is straight.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_101.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 179</span></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 179 shows the pieces of the Noah's Ark hinged together.
The children will find it easier if they paste the hinges on <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">C</span>
first and let them dry
thoroughly; then they
can fasten <span class="smcap">A</span> to <span class="smcap">B</span> and
<span class="smcap">C</span> to <span class="smcap">B</span> and <span class="smcap">D</span>, and lastly
<span class="smcap">D</span> to <span class="smcap">A</span>, but <span class="smcap">B</span> must be
firmly hinged to <span class="smcap">A</span> before
<span class="smcap">C</span> is attached, and
so on with the other
parts. However, there is plenty of work to be done while the
children are waiting for the paste to dry. (In their eagerness to
finish toys the children often want to paste or glue too many
things together at once.)</p>

<p>For the bottom of the ark a piece of cardboard, 13&frac12; inches by
5 inches, is cut and pointed at each end.</p>

<p>For the roof the children can get the measurements themselves.
The long side of the ark is 8&frac12; inches, so that if the roof
projects &frac12; inch on each side of this the length will be 9&frac12; inches.
They must measure <span class="smcap">E F</span> (Fig. 179); this will be about 2&frac12; inches.
Now, the roof must cover <span class="smcap">E F</span> and <span class="smcap">F G</span> and project about a &frac12; inch
beyond <span class="smcap">E</span> and <span class="smcap">G</span>, so that the width of the roof must be 6 inches.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Therefore, they must cut a piece of cardboard 9&frac12; inches by 6 inches.
Down the middle of this a half cut is made, along which the cardboard
is folded. A stronger method is to cut the roof in half and
hinge the two pieces together by a piece of paper cut and coloured
to represent tiles; thus the roof will open and shut easily without
breaking. The roof can be coloured or covered with blue paper.</p>

<p>When the body of the ark is complete, it must be placed on to
the bottom, so that it stands in the middle. Two hinges on each
long side will be sufficient to keep the ark steady, but hinges can
also be made for the shorter sides. The hinges are more easily
put on the outside, but would look neater if fastened inside the ark.</p>

<p>One half of the roof is fastened by paper hinges to three sides of
the ark; the other half opens and shuts.</p>

<p>A strip of cardboard, the width of the door, is cut to form a
gangway for the animals to enter the ark. Across this matches
should be glued.</p>

<p>Very effective animals can be made from corks, as explained
in Chapter VII. Easily made animals are the elephant, camel,
giraffe, horse and donkey. The children will suggest other possible
animals, <i>e.g.</i> a hedgehog,
or porcupine, a small cork
with pins stuck in it, etc.</p>

<p>Noah and his wife and
children can be made from
corks. A cork is filed
round the narrowest end
to form the head (Fig. 180).
Eyes, mouth, etc., can be
marked in ink. Round
Noah is pasted a piece of
coloured paper to form a
cloak, open in front; this,
with the help of match sticks for legs, enables him to stand.
Half matches form the arms. A piece of round paper gummed
to the head forms a hat.</p>

<p>Noah's wife (Fig. 181) has a piece of coloured paper round her
body to form a skirt, on which she stands.</p>

<p><b>A Dog Kennel</b> (Fig. 182). This toy is made of either cardboard
or stiff paper, on lines similar to those of the Noah's Ark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>The bottom and the sides can be made from one piece, 7&frac12; inches
by 4 inches (Fig. 183). Half cuts are made along <span class="smcap">H A</span> and <span class="smcap">B C</span>.
In fixing the front of the kennel it will be noticed that the bottom
and the sides project beyond it. The back portion can be fixed
to coincide with the edges of the bottom and sides. The roof can
be measured and fixed as described in the Noah's Ark. Planks can
be indicated by drawing lines across the sides and the roof. The
kennel may be fastened to two strips of wood, <span class="smcap">Y</span> and <span class="smcap">X</span>.</p>

<p><b>A Shop.</b> This can be made like the Noah's Ark, except that
the bottom will, of course, be a rectangle, and one long side must
be left open. The children can turn cardboard boxes of different
kinds into shops quite easily. Perhaps one of the easiest shops
to make is the butcher's. The inside can be covered with white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
paper, upon which the children have drawn tiles in blue or green
pencil. A little paying-desk (Fig. 184) can be made of brown
paper and gummed to one of
the walls. Tables can be made
of cardboard, or of wood if the
children have begun woodwork.
Joints of meat drawn on cardboard,
and coloured with red
pencil, look very realistic when
cut out. To hang these the
children can hammer nails half
way into a piece of stripwood
and glue it to the wall. The
joints can be attached to the
nails by pieces of string.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 266px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 184</span></div>
</div>

<p>Other toys that can be made in a similar way from stiff paper
or cardboard are castles, houses, a sentry-box.</p>

<p><b>A Wheelbarrow</b> (Fig. 188). This toy is made of cardboard of
medium thickness. Fig. 185 shows how the bottom and the sides
are cut out from one piece. Half cuts are made along the dotted
lines. Small holes are made at <span class="smcap">D</span> and <span class="smcap">C</span> for the axle of the
wheel.</p>

<p>Figs. 186 and 187 show the two ends of the barrow. Before
placing them in position a little seccotine should be put round
their edges; with the help of this and the slits they will be quite
firm.</p>

<p>The wheel is about 7/8 inches in radius. It is mounted on an
axle made of a rounded match stick or piece of cane. Two small
pieces of cork can be filed to the shape of <span class="smcap">E</span> and <span class="smcap">F</span> in Fig. 189, and
holes made through them. They are then slipped on to the axle
on each side of the wheel (Fig. 189) to prevent the latter from
wobbling. The legs are made of strips of cardboard about &frac14; inch
wide and 2&frac12; inches long (Fig. 190).</p>

<p>A very slight half cut is made along the dotted line, so that part
of the leg, <span class="smcap">K</span>, may be bent straight when <span class="smcap">H</span> is gummed to the side of
the wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>Fig. 191 shows another method of making the legs. A half
cut is made along the dotted line, <span class="smcap">H</span> is bent back at right
angles to <span class="smcap">K</span> and is gummed to the side of the barrow. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
slant of the dotted line is the same as the slant of the sides of <span class="smcap">A</span>
in Fig. 186.</p>

SIMPLE WOODWORK</h3>


<p>Children as young as seven can begin woodwork, but the
little strength they possess for sawing makes it necessary
to give them prepared wood, called stripwood. There is no
need, however, to begin woodwork in too great a hurry, so many
are the toys which the children can make with match-boxes,
corks, paper and files, and the more familiar the child gets with
his ruler and with simple measurements, the better able he is to
saw to advantage. Woodwork may well be postponed to the age
of eight or nine, then the child can begin to measure accurately
and be introduced by degrees to the mysteries of set-squares,
try-squares and T-squares.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_106.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 192</span></div>
</div>

<p>The following tools are necessary when beginning easy woodwork
with children from seven to ten years of age; other tools,
described in Part II, can be added as the
children advance in age and in ambition:</p>

<p>1. Bench-hooks, against which children
can press their strips of wood and hold them
firmly. A simple one is shown in Fig. 192.
<span class="smcap">C</span> is a piece of hard wood about 8 inches square, <span class="smcap">A</span> is a strip of
hard wood against which the child can hold her wood, <span class="smcap">B</span> is a strip
of wood that presses against the table.</p>

<p>2. Try-squares.</p>

<p>3. A brass-back saw with a blade about 6 inches long.</p>

<p>4. A light hammer.</p>

<p>5. Files&mdash;these are very cheap. Some must be round; the
others should be 8-inch files, &frac12; cut (one safe edge).</p>

<p>6. Bradawls (or meat skewers).</p>

<p>7. A pair of pincers.</p>

<p>Other materials required will be liquid glue, sand-paper, nails&mdash;useful
ones are &frac34; and &frac12; veneer pins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>With regard to wood, children as young as seven should be
given prepared lengths (schools are commonly supplied with the
so-called satin walnut, machine-planed, see next chapter), from
which they can saw portions for making simple objects, such as
picture frames, ladders, gates, objects which consist of different
lengths of wood nailed across each other.</p>

<p>A word of advice is necessary with regard to sand-paper; this
varies in coarseness from No. 00 to No. 3, every sheet being
stamped. It should never be used until all work with edged tools
is finished, as the particles of sand left on the surface dull an
edged tool. When using sand-paper on a flat surface it should be
wrapped round a rectangular block of wood. All corners should
be left as sharp as they are left by the edged tools and rarely sand-papered.
Lastly, always sand-paper with the grain.</p>

<p>The bradawl varies in size or diameter of the steel shaft
from 1/16 inch to 1/8 inch or 3/16 inch. The legitimate purpose of the
bradawl is to bore holes in wood so as to ensure the passage of a
nail or screw in the right direction, and to facilitate its entrance
into the wood.</p>

<p>Three words of advice might be remembered by teachers
beginning woodwork:</p>

<p>(1) Don't begin it too soon; don't begin woodwork with
children of seven and eight because others do; wait until they
are really ready, until they have the necessary strength. There
is plenty for them to do in measuring and cutting out paper toys
and toys of thin cardboard; they will enjoy the woodwork the
more when it comes.</p>

<p>(2) Simple doll's furniture, chairs and tables, are not easy for
the child to make.</p>

<p>(3) Leave behind as soon as possible prepared stripwood and
its everlasting gates, railings, bridges, or picture frames.</p>

<p><i>Suggestions for Teachers who are beginning Woodwork with
their Forms.</i> Let the children measure out and cut a square of
wood to support the merry-go-round, make the stand for the
swinging boats and great wheel (Chapter XIV). Make the Noah's
Ark and dog kennel described in Chapter X.</p>

<p>A very simple toy for beginners is a <b>Flat-bottomed Boat</b>. A
flat, oblong piece of wood is marked out as in Fig. 193, the bow
and stern are cut as indicated; the three dots down the central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
line indicate the position of the masts. These can be made
of wooden meat skewers or of pieces of strip wood (&frac14;" &times; &frac14;")
rounded toward the top.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_108a.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 193</span></div>
</div>

<p>Nails are driven through the bottom of the boat so that they
project about half an inch above the surface; on to these points
the masts are hammered, having first had a little glue applied to the
base; nails are hammered carefully round the sides for railings,
with cotton intertwined. Funnels of red paper, little squares of
wood for cabins, paper or cardboard lifebuoys and anchors, a
captain's bridge, etc., may be added (see Fig. 194).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_108b.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 194</span></div>
</div>

<p>Children delight in tying thread from mast to mast (a ridge
must be filed round the tops of the masts to keep the cotton from
slipping down) and in decorating this thread with flags.</p>

<p>Instead of nails, stripwood (&frac14;" &times; &frac14;") may be glued or
nailed along the sides, and a piece of wood nailed over the bow
(Fig. 195). These boats will float on water if they are not too
heavily laden with cabins, etc. Fig. 196 shows a fishing-boat
complete.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/i_109a.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 195</span></div>
</div>

<p>A reel will be found very useful as an anvil when driving the
nails through the bottom of the boat to hold the masts. The child
should hold his piece of wood&mdash;through which he is driving a nail&mdash;in
such a position that when the point comes through the wood,
the nail makes its passage down the hole in the middle of the reel.
As soon as the point has been driven through to a certain distance,
the child can lift up his wood and examine&mdash;and if need be correct&mdash;the
direction of the nail before fixing on the mast.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_109b.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 196</span></div>
</div>

<p>Hammering must be done with the hammer held with the hand
well back from the head, and each blow struck so that the flat face
of the hammer falls exactly upon the head of the nail. Gentle
but firm blows are necessary; heavy blows are likely to bend the
nails. All bent nails should be at once drawn out.</p>

MATERIALS</h3>


<p><b>Nails.</b> The nails used in the making of the toys described in the
following chapters are made of very fine wire, with fine points.
The wire commonly used for such nails is 17 gauge, but a finer
gauge (21) is better for light woodwork, for it does not split the
wood so easily. The nails vary in length from &frac14; inch to 2 inches,
increasing by eighths of an inch. The most useful sizes are veneer
pins &frac12; inch in length and &frac34; inch in length.</p>

<p>Panel pins have small heads.</p>

<p><b>Liquid Glue.</b> Though this is dearer than ordinary glue (it
can be obtained in small bottles, price 4-1/2d), it is always ready
for use, and is not affected by exposure to the air, except that it
thickens and hardens from evaporation. If spread thinly over
the wood it holds the various pieces firmly together. When
fastening different pieces of wood together it is well, whenever
possible, both to glue and nail them.</p>

<p><b>Wood.</b> (1) <i>Satin walnut</i> is one of the easiest woods to work,
and is adapted for a wide range of work, but it is liable to warp
and twist badly unless properly seasoned.</p>

<p>For handwork in school, and for toy-making generally, satin
walnut machine-planed can be had in the following useful sizes.
They are supplied in lengths of 2 feet and are done up in bundles
of 100.</p>

<p>
(<i>a</i>) 2' &times; &frac14;" &times; &frac14;" about 2s. 9d. per bundle.<br />
(<i>b</i>) 2' &times; &frac14;" &times; &frac12;"   "   3s.      "    "<br />
(<i>c</i>) 2' &times; &frac12;" &times; &frac12;"   "   3s. 3d.  "    "<br />
(<i>d</i>) 2' &times; &frac14;" &times; 1"     "   4s.      "    "<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">2' &times; &frac14;" &times; 4"&nbsp; &nbsp;  "&nbsp;  9s.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "&nbsp; &nbsp; "</span><br />
</p>

<p>In the toys described in the following chapters satin walnut
lengths (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>), and (<i>d</i>) are referred to simply as stripwood.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Round dowel rods</i> in beech or birch 3/16 inch to 7/8 inch diameter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
and 36 inches long are useful for axles and for the perches for the
swinging animals, etc. These dowel rods cost 3s. to 10s. per 100.
Dowels are made by planing up a strip square in section, then
planing off the corners, and finally the resulting eight corners.
They are now nearly round, and can be made quite so by
hammering them through a hole in a piece of hard wood or
metal.</p>

<p>(3) <i>Sawn laths such as builders use</i> are perhaps the cheapest
material that it is possible to get. These can be got from builders'
and timber-merchants' yards at a cost of about 9d. to 1s. per
bundle of 100. Each lath is 3' 6" &times; 1" &times; 3/16".</p>

<p>(4) "<i>Three-ply</i>" is composed of three thin layers of wood glued
together under pressure. The grain of the centre layer is laid at
right angles to that of the other two, so as to give additional
strength and to avoid warping. "Three-ply" will not split
easily and should be used for the jointed animals and swinging
animals described in Chapter XX.</p>

<p>Ply-wood is usually sold in thicknesses varying from 1/8 inch to
&frac14; inch. Price of three-ply boards in large squares for cutting up:</p>

<p>
1/8  in. thick, 47" &times; 38", 3/4d. per sq. foot.<br />
3/16     "      53" &times; 34", 1d.       "     "<br />
&frac14;      "      72" &times; 48", 1-3/4d.   "     "<br />
</p>

<p><b>Match Stales.</b> These are sometimes useful in toy-making,
though ordinary matches that have been used generally serve as
well. Match stales may be obtained from Messrs Bryant &amp; May's,
Fairfield Works, Bow, E., at 1s. per bundle (about 1500 to the
bundle). These are supplied without brimstone, 4-5/8 inches long,
and thicker than the matches in common use.</p>

<p>Most of the wood so far described is prepared wood (with the
exception of builders' laths), and is ready for use at once; it has
merely to be sawn to the right length or the right size. But it is
well to get the children away as soon as possible from dependence
upon this "prepared material" and to encourage them to use
"waste material."</p>

<p>If there is a kitchen or tuck shop in connexion with the school
this will supply the children with useful wooden and cardboard
boxes of various sizes. The wooden boxes in which Fry's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Cadbury's, etc., chocolates are packed are most useful in toy-making.
The wood is easy to saw and fairly free from knots.</p>

<p>If no school kitchen or tuck shop exists a grocer, for a few
pence, will supply a delightful collection of wooden boxes, sweet-boxes,
soap-boxes, boxes that have contained bovril, etc. The
greater part of every wooden toy in this book has been made from
materials such as these.</p>

<p>To avoid expense one should begin at once to collect useful
boxes; this adds to the enjoyment of toy-making. A tobacconist
will often give away his cigar-boxes, the wood of which is a pretty
brown colour and very useful. Unfortunately, it is sometimes so
thin that it is very liable to split. It is difficult, too, to get the
paper off some boxes, and the children who resort to washing,
scrubbing, and sometimes boiling (!) the wood do not improve
it. However, all waste wood has to be prepared in some way;
generally the file and sand-paper will make it ready for use.</p>

<p>Other materials that are invaluable to the toy-maker and
should be carefully preserved are old broom handles, reels, and the
round rods of various sizes that one often comes across.</p>

<p>Lead plays an important part in many toys; sheet lead can be
bought in pennyworths; lead buttons can also be bought. Chains
are also useful (for example, in Part II, in the drawbridge, the siege
tower, etc.), so toy watch chains or any odd pieces should be preserved,
as these chains look more effective than those made of wire.
Very good chain can be bought from an ironmonger's&mdash;price, 3d.
a yard.</p>

SOME DIFFICULTIES IN TOY-MAKING</h3>


<p>I. <b>Gluing.</b> Generally when pieces of wood are fastened together,
both glue and nails should be used; the glue prevents the wood
from revolving on the nails, and the nails hold when sometimes a
sudden jar will cause pieces of wood that are glued to separate.
However, if glueing be well done, it will serve well without nailing,
and it is often convenient to use glue only when making small toys
or when adding a piece of wood to a delicate toy that will not
stand the shock of the hammer. To apply glue so that the
pieces of wood that it fastens shall hold together permanently, the
following points should be borne in mind:</p>

<p>(1) The layer of glue should be so thin that the seam will
scarcely be seen.</p>

<p>(2) The glue must be perfectly free from sawdust, shavings,
etc., and so must the wood.</p>

<p>(3) Glue must be evenly and thinly applied to <i>both</i> the surfaces
that are to be joined.</p>

<p>(4) The surfaces to be joined must be perfectly smooth.</p>

<p>(5) Time must be given for the glue to dry. Children often
want to touch too soon.</p>

<p>II. <b>Nailing.</b> Generally in nailing holes should first be made for
the nail with a fine bradawl or drill. The holes for the nails should
be made just large enough to allow them to stand upright in them
without being held. The points or heads of nails that project
should always be filed away.</p>

<p>III. <b>Sand-papering.</b> A holder for sand-paper should be used, as
by simply holding the sheet in the fingers it is impossible to retain
the perfect flatness of the surface. A holder can be bought for
twopence. Sand-paper should always be applied with a very light
pressure, lest it wear away the surface unequally.</p>

<p>IV. <b>Filing.</b> Filing should be resorted to as little as possible.
<i>Avoid filing the sawn edges.</i> Children often saw carelessly, relying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
on the file to remedy defects. The file, however, is useful
when cutting discs, to make the circle perfect. Round files are
very useful in finishing off round holes and in enlarging them
when required. The sharp edges of triangular files can
be used for making notches, such as those in the deck-chair
(Part II, Chapter III).</p>

<p>V. <b>The Making of Wheels.</b> The child toy-maker often finds
wheels somewhat of a problem. There are, however, several ways
of making or getting them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_114.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 197</span></div>
</div>

<p>(1) Small reels make good wheels for trams, motor-cars or
trains. They require no sawing. Fig. 197 shows how they are
fastened on. <span class="smcap">A</span> is a block of wood glued and nailed on to the axle,
<span class="smcap">B C</span>, which is made of stripwood, &frac14; &times; &frac14; inch, or &frac12; &times; &frac14; inch;
the ends, <span class="smcap">F B</span> and <span class="smcap">G C</span>, are rounded so that the reels can revolve
easily on them. The bottom of the car is glued to the block.
The reels can be placed quite under the bottom of the car, as
in diagram, or they can project. For a train the wheels should
be placed underneath.</p>

<p>(2) Large reels may be sawn into several thicknesses. These
make excellent wheels, but are very difficult to saw even with a
mitre block. It is hard to hold them steady and there is some
danger of the children sawing their fingers.</p>

<p>(3) Broom handles, round rods, etc., are easily sawn up and
make excellent wheels. Holes have to be drilled through them
and enlarged with round file for the axle, or a hole the right size
can be made at once with the brace and bit. (For use of which
see Part II.)</p>

<p>(4) Wheels can be made with the brace and centre-bit. The
way for the centre-bit must be prepared by using a small-sized
pin-bit. The wood must be laid perfectly flat, the brace and bit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
held perfectly perpendicular, only a little pressure applied upon
the knob and the crank turned slowly. The boring must be done
half way through from each side of the wood, and this will liberate
a disc of wood 1 inch in diameter, or 1&frac14; inch, according to the size
of the centre-bit.</p>

<p>(5) There is a little instrument sold called a circle-cutter (price,
2s.), designed for cutting small circular pieces of wood from
satin walnut board. It is so constructed that it will cut circles of
any size up to 5 inches in diameter. This, however, is difficult for
children to use.</p>

<p>(6) For large wheels or table-tops a circle can be drawn in a
square, the corners sawn off, the obtuse corners sawn off again and
then filed perfectly round. This is rather a laborious method, but
quite successful. Holes can be made in the centre with a bradawl
and enlarged with a round file.</p>

<p>(7) <i>Cardboard Wheels.</i> Wheels can be cut out of cardboard
with scissors and pen-knife (the latter is necessary only if the
spokes are to be cut out). If several cardboard wheels of the
same size are gummed together, a wheel strong enough for any
toy in this book can be made. The edges can be filed to make
them perfectly even. Cardboard washers prevent the wheels from
wobbling.</p>

<p>(8) The fret-saw (see Part II) is very useful for making
wheels.</p>

<p>(9) The wooden tops of gloy bottles make very good wheels
indeed (especially for motor-cars). They are ready for use at
once, as they have a hole in the centre. Also the tin tops of Le
Page's liquid glue make excellent small wheels; a hole can easily
be made in the centre by means of a hammer and a long nail or
the pin stopper of a tube of seccotine.</p>

<p>(10) Wheels can be bought. A sheet of four wheels costs a
penny. This is the least satisfactory course.</p>

<p>Of the various ways of making wheels described above, the
methods best suited to little ones are (1), (3), (6), (7), and (9).
The axles should be narrow strips of wood, with the ends rounded.
Round rods do not make good axles, because they cannot be
fastened securely to the bottom of the vehicle, the nailing being a
difficult matter for the children. In fastening the axles to vans,
carts, etc., there is no need for block <span class="smcap">A</span> (Fig. 197); the latter is only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
introduced when the wheels have to be under the vehicle; in other
cases the axle can be glued and nailed directly to the bottom.</p>

<p><b>Colouring the Finished Toy.</b> A well-made toy is beautiful
without paint, which is often used merely to hide bad work and
give a false appearance of finish. Children generally like the
wooden toys, which they have made, uncoloured, until the grown-up
person suggests paint.</p>

<p>However, some toys should be coloured; for example, the
swinging animals described in Chapter XX. If the wood has been
well sand-papered water-colour paints can be used. Older children
can use oil paints or penny tins of enamel. But let the children
realise the beauty of plain wood; the drawbridge in Part II is
far more effective in white wood, with the stones marked out in
pencil or crayon, than if painted.</p>

MERRY-GO-ROUND, SWINGING BOATS, AND
GREAT WHEEL</h3>


<p>A toy children delight to make is the <b>Merry-go-round</b>
(Plate V). It has been made successfully by children from
six to twelve. A square piece of stout cardboard (10-inch
side) forms the bottom; this can be covered with brown paper or
coloured paper. A reel is glued in the middle. Into this reel
a stick (about 11 inches long)
is fastened securely. Another
piece of cardboard is cut round
(diameter, 10 inches), and has
a reel glued in the middle; this
reel fits on the top of the stick
and must turn freely. If the
stick is square the top must be
rounded to fit the reel. A handle
for turning the top can be made
from a reel, a piece of cork filed
round or a piece of wood. Cork
horses, six or eight
in number, are
made as described
in Chapter VII.
Paper bands of
various colours are gummed round the middle of
each horse. These horses are fastened to the top
disc by pieces of cane, which may be gummed into
the top disc, or simply passed through the holes
and bent over.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 266px;">

<div class="figright" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_117b.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 199</span></div>
</div>

<p>Paper boys and girls can be cut out to ride on
the horses. They will sit on quite steadily if cut out as in
Fig. 199. A piece of paper is folded in two along <span class="smcap">A B</span>, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
little sailor boy drawn; the figure is cut out, the two halves
remaining joined along <span class="smcap">C D</span>. Both sides should be suitably
coloured. The figure will be found to have four hands; one
raised one on one side, and one lower one on the other, should
be cut away. The heads are then gummed together. When
placed on horseback the sailor may have his arms folded round
the cane. Little girls in sun-bonnets can be cut out in the
same way.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_118a.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 200</span></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 198 shows a very simple merry-go-round made by a large
class, and more suited to the work of a large form than the first one
described. Two square pieces of cardboard (3&frac12;-inch sides) form
the top and bottom. Small reels are glued on as in the first merry-go-round.
Four pieces of stout cane are pushed
into holes in the top piece of cardboard, and
the bottom of each piece of cane is split so
that it holds a horse cut out of paper.</p>

<p>The children themselves will think of various
ways of altering and improving this toy. Fig.
200 shows how match-boxes may be hung
round for cars; match-boxes and horses may
also be hung alternately. The
children delight in decorating the top of their
merry-go-round and the stick with coloured
paper.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_118b.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 201</span></div>
</div>

<p>Older children (nine to twelve) like to make
the bottom and top of wood; in this case the
top may be octagonal in shape. The central
pillar, instead of being supported by a reel, can
then be fastened as in Fig. 201, by four triangular supports
(of which only two are shown).</p>

<p><b>Swinging Boats</b> (Plate VI). This is another simple and effective
toy that little ones can make and play with. The wooden
stand can only be made by children of eight and older; a simpler
stand can have a cardboard bottom, the supports being reels, the
posts stripwood (&frac14;" &times; &frac14;"), sand-papered to fit reels, and the cross-beam
a strip of cardboard with holes in it.</p>

<p>The boats are match-boxes. Four strips of thick paper, all
equal in length (a little longer than the match-box), are cut out
and gummed inside the box, as <span class="smcap">A B</span>, <span class="smcap">C D</span>, etc., in Fig. 202. A match
stick, <span class="smcap">H</span>, passes through these strips of paper where they cross and
projects on each side. Pieces of thread are tied to each end of the
projecting ends. These threads fasten the car to the cross-beam.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 202</span></div>

<p>Paper seats should be put in the box; it can be covered with
coloured paper, and the strips <span class="smcap">A B</span>, <span class="smcap">E F</span>, etc., either chalked or
covered with coloured paper. The children delight in making and
decorating these swinging boats, and then swinging little dolls.</p>

<p><b>A Great Wheel</b> (Plate VI). Two circular pieces of cardboard
are glued to a large reel; four match sticks are fastened into
holes opposite each other, and to
these match-boxes are attached, as
explained in the previous toy. A
round rod or wooden skewer passes
through the reel and through two
holes drilled in the wooden supports
of the stand. A slight touch will
set the wheel spinning. Before putting
the wheel together, the sides
may be painted.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 266px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 203</span></div>
</div>

<p>Fig. 203 shows another possible shape
for the top of the supports. This hollow
can be quite easily filed out with a round
file. Older children might like to make a
pulley, as shown in Fig. 204, by means
of which the wheel can be turned. The pulley
wheels, <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span>, are each made of three
cardboard circles gummed together, the inner
one, in both cases, being of smaller diameter. <span class="smcap">A</span> is glued to
axle <span class="smcap">F G</span>.</p>

<p>A smaller axle, <span class="smcap">J H</span>, is fixed into a hole in the support lower

<p>Get a large reel (diameter about 1&frac12; inches). Next saw a
piece of stripwood, <span class="smcap">A B</span>, &frac14;" &times; &frac14;" &times; 12&frac14;". Glue and nail to the ends
of this cross-pieces of the same stripwood, 4&frac12; inches long. Make
holes for nails with a fine drill, otherwise the stripwood may split.
Glue and nail <span class="smcap">A B</span> across the top of the reel as in Fig. 205.</p>

<p>Cut two pieces of stripwood, &frac14;" &times; &frac14;" &times; 6". Glue and nail cross-pieces
4&frac14; inches long to one end of each of these. Glue and nail
them to the reel as in figure.</p>

<p>Next glue and nail another large reel to the centre of a board
about 4 inches by 5&frac34; inches. Get a dowel rod that will fit the reels
(diameter about &frac14; inch), or file the ends of a square stick to fit;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
this central pillar should be about 13 inches high. Glue this pillar
into the reel on the board and fit the other reel with the cross-pieces
on the top of the pillar.</p>

<p>The cars must next be made; they will hang by two strings
from the ends of the cross-pieces (Fig. 206). Grooves may be filed
round the ends of the cross-pieces for tying the cotton, or holes can
be drilled in the ends before the cross-pieces are fastened on.</p>

<p>The cars are made of paper, cardboard or wood. Fig. 207
shows the pattern of a car. It should be 4&frac12; inches long and 2 inches
wide. The dotted lines show where the paper is to be bent, or in
the case of cardboard half cut and bent.</p>

<p>The width of the bottom of the car is 2 inches, the roof 2&frac34;
inches; this allows for bending, and makes a curved roof. The
doors can be made to meet if desired; in this case each door will
be 1 inch wide.</p>

<p>Five, four or three windows may be cut in the sides, and
windows in the doors.</p>

<p>Paper seats may be fitted inside.</p>

<p>To hang the car a rod is cut, about 5 inches long, <span class="smcap">E F</span> in Fig. 206,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
and grooves are filed at each end. This is glued to the top of the
car, with the ends projecting. Pieces of cotton attach the beam
<span class="smcap">E F</span> to the cross-piece. (Length of cotton, about 7 inches.)</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 207</span></div>
</div>

<p>A reel may be glued on the top of the arms for turning the airships;
cotton may be wound round this, and when pulled causes
the cars to revolve. Into the hole of the top reel may be inserted
a stick bearing a flag.</p>

<p>Paint the cars according to taste.</p>

<p>When the top reel is set spinning the cars fly round and outward
in a delightful manner, gradually returning to a vertical
position as the speed lessens.</p>

<p><b>Gondolas.</b> For the cars gondolas may be substituted, as in
Fig. 208. These gondolas form simple and effective paper toys,
even if not attached to revolving arms.</p>

<p>Draw on stout paper or cardboard and cut out the two sides,
<span class="smcap">A A</span>, as in Fig. 208. The total length of the boat should be 9 inches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>Next draw a line on a piece of paper, <i>a&acute; b&acute;</i> in Fig. 209, the
same length as <i>a b</i> in Fig. 208. Divide the line into three parts at
<i>c&acute;</i> and <i>d&acute;</i>. <i>a&acute; c&acute;</i> represents the length <i>a c</i> in Fig. 208; <i>c&acute; d&acute;</i> (not
shown to scale), the length of the cabin <i>c d</i>. If the full length of the
gondola is 9 inches, the length <i>a b</i> will be about 8&frac12; inches, and the
length <i>a c</i> should be 3 inches; this makes the length of the cabin,
<i>c d</i>, about 1&frac34; inches. Draw two lines at <i>c&acute;</i> and <i>d&acute;</i> at right angles to
<i>a&acute; b&acute;</i>. Make <i>e f</i> and <i>g h</i> (Fig. 209) equal to the widest part of the
gondola. (If the length of 9 inches has been decided on, the width
of the gondola should be 1&frac14; inches.) Complete triangles <i>a&acute; f e</i> and
<i>g b&acute; h</i> as in Fig. 209; draw flanges as in diagram and cut out. Two
other triangles exactly the same size with flanges will be required.</p>

<span class="smcap">A A</span> (Fig. 208), with seccotine, taking care that no gum comes below
the line <i>a b</i>. Gum the triangle <i>a&acute; f e</i> (Fig. 209) to the sides, <span class="smcap">A A</span>, as
in Fig. 208. Point <i>a</i> must come at the very end of the sides <span class="smcap">A</span>, and
the surface of <i>a f e</i> forms the deck. Gum triangle <i>g h b&acute;</i> to the sides,
<span class="smcap">A</span>, in the same way (Fig. 208). Now gum the other two triangles to
the bottom of the gondola. Their apexes will probably come at
about <span class="smcap">K</span> and <span class="smcap">M</span> in Fig. 208. The positions of these points can be
determined by finding out at what spot the triangle brings the
sides <span class="smcap">A A</span> closely together; try to keep them as far from ends <i>a</i>
and <i>b</i> as possible.</p>

<p>The gondolas are hung from cross-pieces, like the airships, but
the arms should be 12&frac12; inches, and the cross-pieces 9 inches; the

long. The wooden bottom, <span class="smcap">B C</span>, is 6&frac12; inches by 2&frac14; inches. <span class="smcap">A</span> is glued
to <span class="smcap">B C</span> and kept in position by wooden blocks, <span class="smcap">E</span> and <span class="smcap">F</span>. The funnel
and the dome are made from corks or pieces of round wood; their
ends must be slightly concave, so that they may fit securely to <span class="smcap">A</span>.
A ring of cardboard is gummed to the top of the funnel, which may
have a hole in it to take a piece of cotton-wool for smoke.
The rim of the funnel and the dome are coloured yellow.
The boiler can be covered with dark green or dark red paper.
The buffers are pieces of round rod, to which cardboard discs are
gummed.</p>

<p>(2) <i>The Tender</i> (Fig. 233) can be made in various ways. The
bottom is best made of wood, 4 inches by 2&frac14; inches. The sides may
be made of wood, 4 inches by 1&frac12; inches; the back must be cut to
fit exactly between the sides. When the back and the sides are
glued in position two wedge-shaped blocks may be glued into the
corners for strength. The buffers and the wheels as in the engine.</p>

<p>The sides of the tender may also be cut out of one piece of cardboard
and fastened to the bottom by flanges. It should be
coloured to match the engine. Pieces of cork dipped in ink make
realistic coal.</p>

interior should be
coloured or covered
with paper to represent
upholstering,
etc. Before
fastening the cardboard
to the
bottom, glue to
the corners of the
bottom small
blocks of wood,
1 inch high, as
supports for the
cardboard seats, which should be gummed across them and be
suitably coloured. Cut the cardboard for the top and leave
flanges for fastening it to the ends of the carriage. The top
and the ends are coloured black or dark brown. A little piece
of round wood or cork, coloured black, is gummed to the top
for a lamp. The step is made of stiff brown paper. Small screw
eyes are screwed in the ends of the various parts of the train,
which can be linked together by wire loops.</p>

SWINGING AND JOINTED ANIMALS (<span class="smcap">Plate IX</span>)</h3>


<p>The peacock, monkey, and other animals with long tails can
be cut from cardboard, and by means of lead buttons attached
to their tails be made to swing realistically on a perch.</p>

<p>It is difficult in some animals to get the balance correct and
the position natural. If the drawings in this book are carefully
enlarged and the lead buttons placed on the spot (<span class="smcap">A</span>) indicated, they
will be found to produce satisfactory animals. They look most
effective and move more readily when made from three-ply wood
with the fret-saw (see Part II), but this work is beyond the ten-year-old
child. Children of ten and younger can, however, make
them quite well of cardboard (the thicker the cardboard, providing
the children can cut it with scissors, the better).</p>

<p>A set made of wood by the teacher will form a delightful plaything
for very little ones, and even material for nature lessons.</p>

<p>The <b>Mouse</b> (Fig. 259) should be drawn on cardboard, cut out,
and both sides coloured. If grey cardboard is used, eyes, whiskers,
etc., can be drawn in sepia. Two lead buttons (about the size of halfpennies)
are glued one on each side of the tail (at <span class="smcap">A</span>); pieces of paper
should then be glued over the buttons and painted to match the tail.</p>

<p>Children will find it easier to draw these animals if a piece
of cardboard is given them on which the animal to be drawn will
just fit. The colouring should be as simple as possible to be effective.
The stand is similar to that for the swinging boats, but with
a rounded bar, on which the part of the animal marked <span class="smcap">B</span> will rest.</p>

<p>The <b>Cat</b> (Fig. 256), enlarged, made more fierce-looking and with
stripes painted on it makes a very terrifying tiger, ready to spring.</p>

<p>The <b>Monkey</b> (Fig. 265) may have another monkey swinging
from his tail, and so on.</p>

<p>Animals with movable limbs can also be cut from three-ply
wood (see Part II) or cardboard. If cut from cardboard the
various joints are fastened by small paper-fasteners.</p>

<p>To make the <b>Elephant</b> cut out two pieces the shape of <span class="smcap">A</span> for the
body (Fig. 279), and make four holes in each piece as in the diagram.
Next, cut out four legs, and fasten two to each portion of the
body by little paper-fasteners, then cut out the tail and fasten it
between the two pieces that form the body; cut out two ears and
the head; one fastener will hold the ears, the sides and the head
together; the head is inside the two bodies, the ears outside.</p>

ADDITIONAL TOOLS</h3>


<p>Besides the tools mentioned in Part I, viz., bench-hook, hammer,
saw, file, bradawl, pincers, the following additional tools will be
found of service, though some of these are luxuries, and generally
it is best to use as few as possible:</p>

<p>1. A larger saw, for sawing rougher and larger wood than stripwood,
<i>e.g.</i> a <i>Tenon Saw</i>, length 8 to 16 inches; 10 to 16 points
to an inch, price about one and ninepence.</p>

<p>2. <i>An Archimedean Drill.</i> This is useful for making small
holes when there is danger of the wood splitting, however when
once this drill is used, the worker never again feels inclined to
use a bradawl or any other kind of boring tool. A quite useful
and efficient drill can be bought for sixpence. Care must be
taken that the drill bits or drill points do not break, for being
quite slender and made of tempered steel they are rather fragile.
A set of twelve drill points in assorted sizes in a metal case may
be bought for sixpence. (For hints on the use of drill, see under
fret-saw.)</p>

<p>3. The <i>Cramp</i> or clamp is a contrivance used for holding
boards together. An adjustable <span class="smcap">G</span> cramp is a handy article for
small work. There are several models of <span class="smcap">G</span> cramps; that shown
in the plate costs twopence.</p>

<p>4. A <i>Rasp</i> or rough file for removing from boxes either paper
or the names that are sometimes stamped on them.</p>

<p>5. <i>Brace and Bit.</i> The smallest-sized brace, which has a
sweep of 5 inches, is the most convenient for children. Bits are
of many patterns. The most common form is the <i>Centre-bit</i>
which will cut holes from 3/8 inch to 1&frac12; inches in diameter.</p>

<p>The <i>Pin-bit</i> or shell-bit of the smallest bore is used to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
small-sized holes for screws, etc., but more especially when making
preparation for using the centre-bit.</p>

<p>A <i>Centre-bit</i> 1&frac34; inches in diameter costs ninepence; a brace
and bit (&frac34; inch diameter) together costs one and threepence; this
latter bit is useful for boring holes in wheels for axles, etc.</p>

<p>However the brace and bit is somewhat of a luxury and can
be done without, for holes made with the Archimedean drill can
always be enlarged to the required size, by means of round files
and patience.</p>

<p>6. The <i>Mitre-block</i> is a piece of beech-wood carefully squared
and rebated so as to present throughout its length a rectangular
step-like recess in which the wood to be mitred is placed in order
to be cut at the necessary angle.</p>

<p>In the raised part are three saw kerfs, two at an angle of
45&deg; with the sides of the mitre-block and one half-way between
these at right angles to the sides. The inclination of the saw-cuts
at an angle of 45&deg; is to the right and left respectively, so that
when these angles are brought together in the mitred joint they
may form a perfect right angle (90&deg;). The mitre-block is a luxury,
but it is useful in squaring off the ends of the wood, making picture
frames, making the crane (Chapter V), etc., price sixpence.</p>

<p>A <i>Compass</i>, <i>Protractor</i>, <i>Ruler</i>, <i>Try-square</i> and well-sharpened
<i>Pencil</i> will be found useful in making nearly every toy.</p>

<p>A <i>Plane</i> is not necessary for any of the toys described in the
following chapters, but is mentioned here in case anyone should
require one for reducing the thickness of wood or straightening
a surface. The most economical one is a Jack-plane fitted
with a smoothing-plane iron. The Jack-plane thus equipped
may be used for reducing thicknesses of material (this is the real
function of the Jack-plane) as well as for planing up surfaces true
and smooth (the purpose of the smoothing-plane).</p>

<p>The Jack-plane iron has its cutting edge slightly rounded
in order to gouge out the wood and thus reduce thickness
quickly, the smoothing-plane iron is ground to a straight
edge.</p>

<p>If both these irons are bought, the plane becomes both a
Jack-and a smoothing-plane.</p>

<p>The Stanley Bailey adjustable iron plane is a good one. No. 5
size, 14 inches long, is recommended.</p>

<p>However, as we have said before, it can be done without. The
first four tools are the really necessary ones.</p>

<p><i>The Preservation of Tools.</i> Keep tools in a dry atmosphere
in a wooden box. Have them instantly dried after grinding and
whenever they have been in contact with wet. Iron or steel parts
should be frequently rubbed over with a piece of oily rag (if
grease is used it must be free from salt). A speck of rust must be
removed at once with fine emery-paper and oil.</p>

<p>A generous coating of oil or vaseline should be given when
tools are laid aside for some time.</p>

<p><i>The Sharpening of Tools.</i> Chisels, planes and knives are
sharpened on oilstones. The Lily-white and the Rosy-red
Washita oilstones are perhaps the best natural stones on the
market. With regard to the oil used, machine, engine, neat's
foot and sweet oils are all suitable. Clean the stone after use.</p>

<p>Knives are sharpened at an angle on both sides, and will
therefore have one side rubbed on the stone a few times and will
then be turned over to rub the other side.</p>

<p>Pen-knives can be sharpened on the ordinary kitchen
knifeboard.</p>

<p>Cut a piece of wood, <span class="smcap">D</span>, 2&frac34; inches by 1&frac12; inches, and glue and
nail it to <span class="smcap">A B C</span>. When these pieces are secure drill a hole through
them at <span class="smcap">E</span> for the mast. To carry the guns at the stern, shape
two pieces of wood, <span class="smcap">G</span> and <span class="smcap">F</span>, in the form of circles or octagons,
and glue and nail them in their place. The mast has holes
drilled through it to hold pieces of cane.</p>

<p>Nail &frac14; inch nails round one end of <span class="smcap">D</span> and tie black thread round
them.</p>

<p>The guns are made of small rolls of brown paper, narrower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
at one end and painted black or grey. They are glued in position.
The guns <span class="smcap">H</span> and <span class="smcap">K</span>, are fastened to a small piece of wood, <span class="smcap">L</span>, to raise
them above the level of the deck.</p>

<p>The funnels are made of pieces of round wood or rolls of
paper. The whole boat is painted grey, and rigged with black
thread.</p>

<p>A <b>Liner</b> (Fig. 284). The foundation of the boat is a piece
of wood 10&frac12; inches by 1&frac12; inches, and about &frac14; inch in thickness,
or thicker if possible. Shape the bow as in the figure. Round
the stern.</p>

<p>Cut two pieces of cardboard 7&frac12; inches by 1&frac12; inches. These are
for the decks (Fig. 286), and their stern ends must be shaped to
correspond to the stern of the boat. Place them together on
the foundation and make holes right through along their edges
about &frac12; inch apart.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 266px;">

<p>Cut two pieces of stripwood &frac12;" &times; &frac14;" &times; 6&frac12;". Place them one
over the other and drill a hole (&frac14; inch in diameter) at <span class="smcap">P</span>, about
1&frac34; inches from
one end; this
hole is to receive
the mast, <span class="smcap">B</span>.
Along each piece
of stripwood mark little doors and windows or port-holes.
Glue each piece of stripwood along the middle of each
cardboard deck, as in Fig. 285, having made holes in the cardboard
corresponding to the holes <span class="smcap">P</span> drilled in the stripwood. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
glue the stripwood of one piece to the middle of the cardboard
of the other piece, taking care that the holes in each piece of cardboard
are over each other (Fig. 286). While these pieces are
drying, drill a hole about 2 inches from the bow for the mast <span class="smcap">A</span>;
drill holes along the edge of the bow (<span class="smcap">C D E</span>), 1/3 an inch apart.
Cut pieces of cane 7/8 inch to fit through the holes in the cardboard,
and pieces about 3/8 inch in length for railings round the
bow. Now glue the stripwood, <span class="smcap">G</span>, to the boat so that ends <span class="smcap">H</span> and
<span class="smcap">K</span> correspond with
the edge of the
stern. While this
is drying prepare
the masts. The
mainmast is about
4 inches in length; this length allows it to stand 3 inches above
the upper cardboard deck; the foremast is about 5 inches.
Round the foremast glue a circular piece of cardboard, <span class="smcap">M</span>, resting
on a nail passing through the mast. Hammer a nail through
at <span class="smcap">L</span> for a spar, and put a piece of cane through a hole at <span class="smcap">N</span>.</p>

<img src="images/i_171.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 286</span></div>
</div>

<p>Glue the masts into position. Put in a nail at <span class="smcap">O</span> in the stern,
and a piece of cane, <span class="smcap">D</span>, at the bow. Hammer in three nails in
side <span class="smcap">D C</span> and three on the other side for rigging. Insert the strips
of cane through the holes in the cardboard; put a little glue into
the holes in the wooden deck, and tap the cane in very gently;
put the smaller pieces of cane into the holes round the bow.
Tie cotton round the pieces of cane as in Fig. 284; tie cotton to
masts, etc.</p>

<p>The funnels are made of rolls of paper. If the liner is a
Cunarder, the funnels should be red with black bands round the
top and two black lines lower down. The wooden sides of the
boat are painted dark brown.</p>

<p>A piece of flat wood 2&frac12; inches by 5&frac12; inches forms the bottom of the
car. Two pieces of wood, 5&frac12; inches by 1 inch, are marked out and
sawn as in Fig. 287. If it is found too difficult to saw out the
corner pieces <span class="smcap">E F G</span> and <span class="smcap">H K L</span>, piece <span class="smcap">A E C M</span> can be cut right off,
by sawing along a line <span class="smcap">E M</span>; <span class="smcap">G M H N</span> can be cut off by sawing
along lines <span class="smcap">G M</span> and <span class="smcap">H N</span>, the same with <span class="smcap">L N B D</span>.</p>

<p>The corners <span class="smcap">E</span>, <span class="smcap">F</span>, <span class="smcap">G</span>, <span class="smcap">H</span>, <span class="smcap">K</span>, <span class="smcap">L</span> should be rounded with a file, as
shown in the plate. The two side-pieces are then glued at each
side of the bottom. Front and back pieces are then cut, and
fitted between the bottom and sides; also a top to fit over <span class="smcap">A E</span>,
and seats to fit over <span class="smcap">G H</span> and <span class="smcap">L B</span>.</p>

<p>These seats are then provided with backs and arms as shown
in the plate. Axles and wheels should be made and put on as
described in Part I, Chapter XIII. The wheels should be &frac12; an
inch thick and have the edges rounded to represent the tyre.
Lastly the steering pillar, with cardboard wheel attached, is fixed
into bottom.</p>

<p>A drawback to this toy is that it is made of so many separate
pieces of wood, but children delight in it and can make it most
successfully. Children from nine to twelve have turned out
most effective motor-cars.</p>

<p><b>A Swinging Cradle</b> (Fig. 288). The <i>cradle</i> is a wooden box,
5 inches by 2&frac34; inches, and 2 inches deep. Before nailing this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
together, holes must be drilled in the two short sides, large enough
to take a wooden axle about &frac14; inch in diameter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span> are two pieces of stripwood &frac14;" &times; &frac12;" &times; 5"; their tops

A CRANE</h3>


<p><b>A Crane.</b> <i>Foundation</i>, <i>Arm</i>, <i>Pulley</i>. Cut a piece of wood about
5&frac12; inches by 4&frac12; inches (<span class="smcap">H</span> in Fig. 304). Cut a second piece
a square, <span class="smcap">A</span>, side 2&frac12; inches. Cut off the corners. This forms a
stand on which the crane, etc., is fastened.</p>

<p>Cut a piece of stripwood, &frac14;" x &frac12;" x 8". This is the arm of
the crane, <span class="smcap">C</span>, and is usually inclined at an angle of 45&deg; to 60&deg;.
To support this arm cut <span class="smcap">B</span> with sides about &frac34; inch, angles 45&deg;
or 60&deg; and 30&deg;.</p>

<img src="images/i_179_305.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 305</span></div>
</div>

<p>Cut two pieces of stripwood &frac14; inch by &frac14; inch, each 2 inches
in length; shape like <span class="smcap">E</span> and <span class="smcap">F</span> in Fig. 305. These can now be
glued and nailed to the arm <span class="smcap">C</span>, projecting an inch beyond.</p>

<p>A wheel for the pulley is cut from a round rod about &frac34; inch in
diameter.</p>

<p>If a groove is to be made round the circumference, the wheel
should be about &frac14; to 3/8 inch thick. The groove is made with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
file. A simple way to make the groove is to cut two cardboard
discs a little larger in diameter than the wheel and glue them to
each side of the wheel, in which case the latter need not be quite
so thick. A hole is drilled through the wheel and enlarged by a
round file to &frac14; inch in diameter.</p>

<p>A piece of wood is now rounded for an axle, so that the wheel
turns on it easily. This must fit tightly between <span class="smcap">E</span> and <span class="smcap">F</span>. Pass
it through the wheel and glue it in position (G in Fig. 305).</p>

<p><i>Winding Gear.</i> Cut two pieces of stripwood, &frac14;" x &frac12;" x 2",
<span class="smcap">J</span> and <span class="smcap">K</span> in Fig. 304. Round their tops, drill and enlarge holes in
them.</p>

<p>A hole must now be made through the centre of <span class="smcap">A</span>, to enable
this part to rotate on the foundation <span class="smcap">H</span>, so that the crane may
swing round in any direction. One of the simplest ways of doing
this is to use a rivet, but if such is not procurable a screw may be
used; the hole in <span class="smcap">A</span> is made large enough for <span class="smcap">A</span> to turn easily on
the pivot which can be screwed into <span class="smcap">H</span>. Before this is done,
pieces <span class="smcap">J</span> and <span class="smcap">K</span> are fastened to <span class="smcap">A</span> about one inch apart. To do this,
drive nails right through <span class="smcap">A</span> in correct positions, glue the ends of
<span class="smcap">J</span> and <span class="smcap">K</span> and hammer them on to the nails. The head of the nail
should rest on a piece of metal when the wood is being hammered
down on its point.</p>

<p>The support <span class="smcap">B</span> should now be glued and nailed to <span class="smcap">A</span>. When <span class="smcap">B</span>
is firmly fixed the arm <span class="smcap">C</span> is fastened to it. The hole in the centre
of <span class="smcap">A</span> must be left clear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A</span> is now riveted or screwed to <span class="smcap">H</span>. A wooden axle, <span class="smcap">P</span>, is made
to pass through holes in <span class="smcap">J</span> and <span class="smcap">K</span>, and to the ends of this axle wheels
are glued. (The figure shows one only.) The wheels can be
made from reels, or several discs of cardboard gummed together.
Before glueing on the wheels, wooden handles, <span class="smcap">L</span>, are fastened
to them. A wooden handle <span class="smcap">O</span> is fastened to <span class="smcap">A</span>. This is used for
turning the crane. A piece of stout thread is tied to and wound
round <span class="smcap">P</span> and passed over the pulley. To the end of this a hook
is fastened, made from wire or a bent pin. Bags can be made
and filled with sawdust, etc.</p>

WINDMILL, WATER-WHEEL, AND WELL</h3>


<p><b>Windmill</b> (Plate XII). Cut a square of wood, side 5 inches.
This is the stand <span class="smcap">A</span> in Fig. 306. To the centre of this glue a
large reel, <span class="smcap">B</span>.</p>

<p>Next cut two 4-inch squares of wood and drill through their
centres holes of about &frac14; inch in diameter. Glue one to the top
of the reel so that the holes coincide. Next cut and glue into
position the supports, <span class="smcap">C</span>. For these stripwood &frac12; inch by &frac12; inch
can be used.</p>

<p>Cut two pieces of wood, 4 inches by 6 inches. These form two
sides of the windmill; glue and nail them to the other 4-inch
square, which forms the bottom of the windmill.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 309</span></div>
</div>

<p>Next cut two pieces of wood as in Fig. 307, for the other
sides of the windmill. Drill a small hole in each at <span class="smcap">D</span> about
1&frac12; inches from the top.</p>

<p>On one of these sides mark and paint a door and windows as
in Fig. 308, and over the door make a small roof, like the roof
over the porch of the signal-box (Chapter XII). The windows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
and door may be cut out with a fret-saw and the door hinged on
by means of a strip of strong linen. Glue and nail these sides in
position. Make and fix the roof.</p>

<p><i>The Sails.</i> For these, two strips of wood, &frac14; inch square and
12 inches long, are necessary.</p>

<p>In the centre of each of these, cut a slot half-way through
the wood so that one may fit tightly into the other (<span class="smcap">F</span> in Fig. 309).
The sails are made of cardboard, and are rectangular in shape,
measuring 5 inches by 2 inches. They are coloured light brown,
with dark markings on them, as shown in the plate. Shape each
end of the arms of the sails as in Fig. 309. This is easily done
by filing, if the wood is fairly soft. Saw half-way through the
wood at <span class="smcap">E</span>, and file, or cut off the wood with a pen-knife. To
this flat surface the sails are glued, so that they may be inclined
to the wind. Now glue the two arms together, and when they
are firm make a hole through the middle, <span class="smcap">F</span>, where the arms
cross. Take a short steel knitting needle, about 6&frac34; inches;
fix one end into this hole with glue; then glue a small piece
of cardboard or wood over it, and a cork washer behind, to keep
the sails from touching the walls of the windmill; pass the
needle through the holes in the sides of the windmill and glue
a little knob of wood to the other end to prevent the needle
slipping back. If a needle cannot be obtained, an old bicycle
spoke, or even a wooden meat skewer, will do, but in the latter
case the holes in the walls must be made larger, and the sails
fixed to the end of the skewer by a small nail.</p>

<p>Now glue a piece of round rod into the reel (<span class="smcap">H</span> in Fig. 306) so
that it projects about an inch. Place the mill on this stand, so
that the rod passes through the hole in the bottom of the mill.
The mill can be turned round in any direction so that the sails
may catch the wind. Make a small ladder to reach the door.</p>

<p>A very pretty but somewhat more difficult windmill is shown
in Fig. 310. It is made of cardboard. The foundation, platform
and railings can be made as described in the case of the lighthouse
(Chapter XIII).</p>

<p>The truncated hexagonal pyramid forming the body of the
windmill is made as follows. With centre <span class="smcap">O</span> (Fig. 311), and a
radius of about 10 inches, describe an arc, <span class="smcap">A B</span>.</p>

<p>From any point on this arc mark off six spaces, each 2 inches.</p>

Join the several points to each other and to <span class="smcap">O</span>. With radius
about 3 inches make arc <span class="smcap">C D</span>. Join points where <span class="smcap">C D</span> cuts radii,
by dotted lines. Draw the flanges; make half cuts along the
dotted lines, cut out along the dark lines, and fold into shape.
Fasten together with seccotine; turn in the flanges at the bottom,
and fasten them to the platform.</p>

<p>The <i>Top of the Windmill</i> can be cut from one piece of cardboard.
Draw square, <span class="smcap">A B C D</span> (Fig. 312), large enough to project
beyond top of hexagonal pyramid (side of square should be about
3 inches). On the middle of <span class="smcap">D C</span> draw <span class="smcap">M K</span> = 4 inches, and draw
a similar line on <span class="smcap">A B</span>. Join <span class="smcap">A J</span>, <span class="smcap">J B</span>, <span class="smcap">K D</span> and <span class="smcap">K C</span>, by curved lines.
Produce <span class="smcap">A B</span> and <span class="smcap">D C</span> both ways. Make <span class="smcap">B F</span>, <span class="smcap">C E</span>, <span class="smcap">D H</span>, <span class="smcap">A G</span>, equal in
length to arc <span class="smcap">B J</span>. Draw the flange <span class="smcap">E F P O</span>. Make holes in the
middle of <span class="smcap">A J B</span> and <span class="smcap">D K C</span> through which the knitting-needle (on
which the sail is fastened) may pass. Draw flanges on <span class="smcap">B J</span>, <span class="smcap">J A</span>, etc.
Make half cuts along the dotted lines, and cut along the dark lines.</p>

<p>Before fastening the top together, put a very small paper-clip
through the middle of square, <span class="smcap">A B C D</span>, and fasten it to a square of
cardboard of the same size, so that it turns freely on it. This
second square will be gummed to the top of the hexagonal
pyramid, so that the top of the windmill may be turned in any
direction. Bend up <span class="smcap">A J B</span> and <span class="smcap">D K C</span> at right angles to square,
<span class="smcap">A B C D</span>. Bend up <span class="smcap">B C E F</span> and <span class="smcap">A D H G</span> and gum them to the
flanges of <span class="smcap">A J B</span> and <span class="smcap">D K C</span>; gum flange <span class="smcap">F O</span> to <span class="smcap">A D H G</span>. The
sails are made as already described.</p>

<p><b>A Water-wheel</b> (Plate XII). <i>The Wheel.</i> Cut two discs
of cardboard, 4 inches in diameter. Make holes in the centre,
glue them to a small reel (about an inch high), and pass a round
rod through for an axle. This wheel is an overshot water-wheel&mdash;that
is, one that receives the water <i>shot over</i> the top, and must
be fitted with 'buckets.' These receive the water at the top
of the wheel and retain it until they reach the lowest point (see
Fig. 313).</p>

<p>The 'buckets' may be made of stiff paper or thin cardboard.
Cut pieces 1 inch in width, and in length the distance
of the two wheels apart plus &frac12; an inch. Mark these out as in
Fig. 314, where <i>a b</i> is the distance between the wheels, and
<i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i> are flanges for fastening the bucket to the wheels. Fold
as in Fig. 315. Make at least twelve of these buckets; divide
the wheel into twelve parts, and fasten the buckets between the
wheels.</p>

<p>To make the toy technically correct, the buckets should rest
against a solid wheel contained within the two outer ones, as in
Fig. 313, so that no water can run down toward the centre of the
wheel. This can be easily managed, if desired, in the following
manner:</p>

<p>Before fastening the wheels to the reel, cut a long strip of paper,
with flanges, as in Fig. 316, in which <i>a b</i> is the distance between
the two outer wheels. Describe a smaller circle on one of the
wheels, about 3 inches in diameter; glue the reel in position, then
bend down the flanges of this strip of paper (Fig. 316), and gum
these round the smaller circle of the wheel. Now gum the other
wheel to the reel and to the flanges of the paper.</p>

A hole is made in the side of the house, into which the axle of the
wheel is inserted; the other end is held by the upright standard
shown in the plate. The shoot may be made of cardboard; it
should slope a little and should come just over the top of the

DRAWBRIDGE AND SIEGE TOWER</h3>


<p><b>A Drawbridge</b> (Plate XII). Two pieces of wood for the front,
<span class="smcap">H</span> and <span class="smcap">I</span> (Fig. 320), must first be sawn 11 inches by 2&frac12; inches.
The white wood of chocolate boxes, etc., is the best.</p>

<p>Next two strips of wood, 7" &times; &frac14;" &times; &frac14;" are cut (satin walnut
stripwood will do)&mdash;<span class="smcap">D E</span> and <span class="smcap">F G</span> in Fig. 321.</p>

<p>The bridge is made of a piece of white wood, 2-5/8 inches by
5&frac14; inches. The posts, <span class="smcap">D E</span> and <span class="smcap">F G</span>, are nailed to the bridge so that
the bridge turns on the nails. (Note that the bridge is nailed
about 3&frac14; inches from bottom of post.)</p>

<p>Next two lengths of stripwood, <span class="smcap">R S</span>, are sawn 10" &times; &frac12;" &times; &frac14;",
these are nailed to pieces <span class="smcap">H</span> and <span class="smcap">I</span> (nails are about 8&frac12; inches
from bottom), so
that the portions
<span class="smcap">R T</span> project about
5&frac12; inches. The
strips <span class="smcap">R S</span> turn
freely on their
nails.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 321</span></div>
</div>

<p>Before nailing
them in position,
their ends should
be rounded as in
the figure. The
posts <span class="smcap">G F</span> and
<span class="smcap">D E</span> (which hold
the bridge) are
then glued to <span class="smcap">H</span>
and <span class="smcap">I</span>. A piece
of wood, <span class="smcap">V</span>, about 8 inches by 2-1/3 inches, is glued to the lower
parts of <span class="smcap">H</span> and <span class="smcap">I</span>, and joins them together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>Next the piece of wood <span class="smcap">Q</span> is cut; its width will be the distance
of post <span class="smcap">F G</span> from <span class="smcap">D E</span> (about 2&frac12; inches)&mdash;this distance should
be carefully measured so that the piece fits well; its length will
be about 5 inches. The arch is cut with a fret-saw. Piece <span class="smcap">Q</span> is
kept in position by having the ends of the arch glued to posts
<span class="smcap">F G</span> and <span class="smcap">D E</span>, and by a length of stripwood (&frac12; inch by &frac14; inch) glued
along the top as shown in the plate. Lengths of stripwood (&frac12; inch
by &frac14; inch) may also be glued down the sides. Holes must be
drilled in the ends, <span class="smcap">R</span>, for wire loops, care being taken that these
holes are over the bridge; wire loops must be placed on the
bridge exactly underneath, and these loops are joined by chains,
which can be made of wire or else bought from an ironmonger.</p>

<p>Fig. 320 shows the inside of the drawbridge; <span class="smcap">A</span>, <span class="smcap">B</span>, <span class="smcap">C</span> and <span class="smcap">D</span>
are the lead weights for raising and lowering the beams. These
weights can be cut from a piece of sheet lead or may be lead
buttons. They are attached to the beams by chains and wire
hooks. <span class="smcap">E F</span> is a ledge for the defenders of the bridge to stand on.
Sides have been added and a platform, <span class="smcap">L</span>. The battlements,
<span class="smcap">G</span>, <span class="smcap">H</span>, <span class="smcap">K</span>, etc., are made of pieces of stripwood &frac12;" &times; &frac12;" &times; &frac14;", glued
round the top.</p>

<p>The ladder is made of matches as described in Chapter IX.</p>

<p><b>A Movable Siege Tower</b> (Plate XIII). Two pieces of wood
(<span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span> in Fig. 322) are sawn to the shape and measurements of
Fig. 323. To the broader ends of these, pieces of stripwood
&frac12; inch by &frac12; inch are glued and nailed (<span class="smcap">C</span> in Fig. 323), and other
pieces, <span class="smcap">D</span>, &frac14; inch by &frac14; inch (about three on each side), are
fastened at equal distances apart. <span class="smcap">D</span><sub>3</sub> and the corresponding
piece on the other side must not extend to edge of <span class="smcap">B</span>, but a space
must be left of &frac12; inch for the posts of the drawbridge.</p>

<p>Next the wood is cut for the foundation and the platforms,
<span class="smcap">J</span>, <span class="smcap">H</span>, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A</span> stands about 6 inches from <span class="smcap">B</span>, so this must be the width
of all the platforms, except the foundation, <span class="smcap">F</span>, which is wider and
projects about &frac34; inch on each side of <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span>, and the platform <span class="smcap">K</span>,
which rests on <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span>.</p>

<p>The other dimensions of the platforms will be the same as
those of the pieces of stripwood on which they rest. The platform
<span class="smcap">K</span> must be about &frac14; inch narrower than tops of <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span>,
to leave room for posts <span class="smcap">L</span> and <span class="smcap">M</span>. <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span> are now glued and nailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
to the base by means of the pieces of stripwood, <span class="smcap">C</span>, at their ends,
and the platforms are glued in position.</p>

<p>Two pieces of stripwood &frac14; inch by &frac12; inch, <span class="smcap">S</span> and <span class="smcap">T</span> in Fig. 324, are
now cut equal in length to distance of <span class="smcap">K</span> from <span class="smcap">H</span>, for the supports
of bridge. Place these in position between <span class="smcap">K</span> and <span class="smcap">H</span>, and measure
distance between them; this gives width of drawbridge; its
length is 6&frac14; inches. This can now be sawn. Fix in position as
explained for previous toy.</p>

<p>Next cut two pieces of stripwood &frac12;" &times; &frac14;" &times; 10&frac12;", <span class="smcap">L</span> and <span class="smcap">M</span>.
At the ends of these drill holes, &frac14; inch in diameter, through which
passes the chain of the drawbridge. Fix these in position by
triangular wedges glued to sides and to platform <span class="smcap">J</span>.</p>

<p>On top, <span class="smcap">K</span>, add struts to support <span class="smcap">M</span> and <span class="smcap">L</span>, as shown in the
plate. The chains of the drawbridge are looped over nails
driven into <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span>, just above platform <span class="smcap">J</span>.</p>

<p>The base may be mounted on small wheels and strengthened
with projecting beams by which the tower may be pushed into
position. (These are not shown in plate.) Ladders to reach
the top can also be made (see Chapter IX), and a battering
ram may be swung from platform <span class="smcap">H</span>, as shown in the plate. A
tower of this kind was used by the Crusaders in the siege of
Jerusalem (1099).</p>

WAR ENGINES PAST AND PRESENT</h3>


<p><b>A War Engine</b> (Plate XIII). This piece of artillery was used at
the time of the crusade of Richard I. It is a simple and interesting
model to make. The sides (<span class="smcap">A B C D</span> in Fig. 325) are built up
of pieces of stripwood &frac14; inch by &frac14; inch, length about 3 inches, or the
sides may be pieces of cigar-box. If made of stripwood, grooves
can be filed in the two bottom pieces to make holes, <span class="smcap">E</span>, when these
pieces are glued together. A round rod passes through these
holes to form a windlass. Two posts, <span class="smcap">F</span> and <span class="smcap">G</span>, &frac14;" &times; &frac12;" &times; 3&frac14;", are
glued to the sides about 1&frac12; inches from end, <span class="smcap">A C</span>, as in figure; these
must either have holes drilled through them for a rod of wood (or
thick wire) or have circular grooves filed in the tops into which
a rod can be glued.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_197.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 325</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>The sides <i>a b c d</i> and <span class="smcap">A B C D</span> should be about 2&frac12; inches apart,
and are kept together by pieces of stripwood glued across
the bottom. Make struts as in the figure to support posts <span class="smcap">F</span>
and <span class="smcap">G</span>.</p>

<p>The beam <span class="smcap">H K</span> may be made from a piece of stripwood,
&frac12; &times; &frac12; &times; 5", filed to a round shape. Two pieces of wire, <span class="smcap">L L</span>, are bent
to form a fork and two hooks, <span class="smcap">M</span> and <span class="smcap">N</span> are bound firmly to one
end with thread. The other end, <span class="smcap">K</span>, has a small screw-eye screwed
into it through which passes a wooden bolt to keep the rings of
lead, <span class="smcap">O</span>, from slipping off. These rings of lead are easily made from
strips cut from a piece of sheet lead and bent round the beam.
(A pair of old scissors should be kept for cutting lead, or a knife
and hammer may be used.)</p>

<p>Now the beam <span class="smcap">H K</span> must be fastened to rod <span class="smcap">P Q</span>. This may be
done in different ways. The simplest but least effective way is
to bind the beam firmly in the middle to the rod with thread or
elastic.</p>

<p>A second way is to drill a hole through the beam, through
which the thread or elastic that binds it to the rod can pass. The
best way perhaps is to make the hole in the beam large enough
for rod <span class="smcap">P Q</span> to pass through, and then bind it to the rod with elastic
or thread or, if a large model is being made, catgut. (A jeweller
is generally ready to give away a small quantity of this.) A
barrel, <span class="smcap">R</span>, can be filed or cut from a small piece of wood or cork, or
it may be a small reel.</p>

<p>To work the machine pull the beam down by means
of a piece of thread looped on to the hook <span class="smcap">M</span> and wound
around the windlass. When the beam head is down, place the
barrel on the fork and keep it in position by rope, <span class="smcap">S</span>. When
the beam head is released, it flies up and the barrel is shot
forward.</p>

<p>This trapget or war engine was used for casting Greek fire,
with which the barrel was filled. It may interest the maker of
this toy to know its composition. In the words of an old writer:
"You make Greek fire thus: Take quick-sulphur, dregs of wine,
Persian gum, 'baked salt,' pitch, petroleum, and common oil.
Boil these together. Then whatever is placed therein and lighted,
whether wood or iron, cannot be extinguished except with vinegar
or salt."</p>

<p>Generally this engine had a kind of wooden hood in front to
protect those working the machine (Fig. 326). This hood is
easily made of stripwood or an
old cigar-box. Notice that the
stripwood that forms the sides,
<span class="smcap">A B C D</span>, must be longer (extended
in diagram to <span class="smcap">S T</span>), so that strips
of wood, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, can be nailed
and glued as in diagram.</p>

<p>The <b>Mangonel</b>, Fig. 327 (an
instrument for casting great stones
to beat down walls and to slay the
enemy), makes an interesting toy.</p>

<p>First cut two pieces of wood, 10&frac14; inches by 1&frac34; inches (the sides
of a wooden chocolate box will do when sawn the right size and
filed), and shape them as in Fig. 328. Saw slits in both pieces at
<span class="smcap">G</span>, &frac14; inch wide and &frac12; inch deep. If two saw-cuts are made for
each slit the wood between can be cut away with a pen-knife.
These slits must be about 2&frac34; inches from end, <i>b d</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>With a round file make semicircles at <i>c</i> and <i>e</i> to hold the
rollers on which the engine is moved into position.</p>

<p>With a bradawl and round file make holes, <span class="smcap">F</span>, in both pieces
about 3&frac12; inches from end, <span class="smcap">A</span> (diameter of hole about 3/8 inch, or
larger if a larger windlass is required).</p>

<p>Put these two pieces aside, and next saw a length of stripwood,
&frac12;" &times; &frac12;" &times; 5"; saw a slit about &frac14; inch from one end and
hammer it on the metal top of a bottle of Le Page's liquid glue
as in Fig. 329. The corner <i>a</i> should be cut or filed off. A small
screw-eye is screwed into the wood just below the metal top. Saw
a piece of stripwood, &frac12;" &times; &frac14;" &times; 3&frac12;", tie this firmly with elastic
to the other end of the first piece of stripwood as in Fig. 330.
This elastic constitutes the propulsive force. The ancients used
catgut, which formed a thick coil, stretched from <span class="smcap">H</span> to <span class="smcap">K</span>, the lever
passing through the middle of the coil. The pulling down of the
lever gave additional twist to the coil, which reacted strongly
on release. Now fasten the sides <i>a b c d</i> and <span class="smcap">A B C D</span> together by
nailing and glueing them to two pieces of stripwood, &frac12;" &times; &frac12;" &times; 2&frac14;".
Then glue <span class="smcap">H K</span> securely into the slots <span class="smcap">G</span> so that the beam with the
stone-holder <span class="smcap">M</span> is upright. Push a round stick through the holes
<span class="smcap">F</span>, for a windlass; this can have holes drilled in the portions that
project, to hold sticks for turning the rod. A piece of thread is
tied to the screw-eye <span class="smcap">Q</span>, and wound round the windlass <span class="smcap">F</span>; when
this thread is tightened the beam is pulled down, then when let
go it flies up, causing anything placed in the tin, <span class="smcap">M</span>, to be shot
some distance. The safest 'stones' to put in this pan are pieces
of cork or small pieces of wood. The following additions can be
made to the model:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) <span class="smcap">RR</span> are pieces of stripwood, &frac12;" &times; &frac14;" &times; 4", glued to the sides
and carrying a strip, <span class="smcap">T</span>. This strip <span class="smcap">T</span> in the olden days was
covered with leather and was so placed that the beam
carrying the stone-holder would abut against it. Notice
the struts <span class="smcap">W</span> for supporting the posts <span class="smcap">R</span>.</p>

<p>(2) <span class="smcap">N O</span> is a rod (about &frac14; inch in diameter) passing through
two small screw-eyes fixed in a piece of stripwood, <span class="smcap">S</span>,
&frac12;" &times; &frac14;" &times; 3&frac14;". A piece of strong wire, <span class="smcap">P</span>, passes through
hole in rod <span class="smcap">N O</span>; it is bent so that it cannot work out,
and the other end is bent to just catch the holder, <span class="smcap">M</span>, when
it is pulled down. A releasing handle is fastened to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
rod, <span class="smcap">N O</span> at <span class="smcap">O</span>. The beam <span class="smcap">S</span> is glued into slots in <span class="smcap">A B C D</span>
and <i>a b c d</i>, so that when the beam is pulled down the catch
<span class="smcap">P</span> clutches <span class="smcap">M</span>.</p>

<p>(3) Small screw-eyes may be screwed in at <span class="smcap">A</span>, <i>a</i>, <span class="smcap">B</span>, <i>b</i>, for holding
ropes to fasten the machine to pegs in the ground. Rollers
may also be made to fit under <span class="smcap">C</span> and <span class="smcap">E</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>This toy is an attractive one, because it really works successfully.
It must be strongly put together, for the beam when pulled
down flies up with considerable force.</p>

<p>Stone-throwers like this were used at the siege of Acre. Very
often these engines had special names given to them. For example
Philip of France had a very good engine of war called 'The Bad
Neighbour,' and inside Acre the Turks had one called 'The Bad
Kinsman.'</p>

<p><b>Cannons of the Fourteenth Century.</b> These are very easily
made. Figs. 331 and 332 show two that can be copied.</p>

<p>In Fig. 331 a piece of wood is cut to the shape of <span class="smcap">A B</span>; a groove
is then filed in it, into which the cannon <span class="smcap">C</span> is glued. The cannon
may be made of a roll of brown paper (two pieces may be pasted
together for greater strength) with four bands of cartridge paper
painted yellow and gummed round it, or it may be a piece of
wood filed to shape and circled with bands of lead.</p>

The stripwood cart which the cannon rests on must be made to fit
the mantle-box; the shafts <i>a</i> may be straight or curved. Round
holes may be cut at <i>b</i>. This same cannon may be fitted with

<p>Toward the end of the fifteenth century artillery was much
improved.</p>

<p>Fig. 335 shows a gun that is interesting to make.</p>

<p>The carriage consists of two pieces of stripwood, &frac12;" &times; &frac14;" &times; 8"
(<i>a b</i> and <i>c d</i> in Fig. 335). A cannon, <span class="smcap">E</span>, is made out of a roll of brown
paper, length 3&frac12; inches, diameter about &frac34; inch, and glued between
<i>a b</i> and <i>c d</i>, or it may simply rest on cross-pieces of wood
joining <i>a b</i> and <i>c d</i>. <span class="smcap">G</span> is a piece of wood, &frac14;" &times; &frac34;" &times; 3&frac12;", turning
on a pin or piece of wire, <span class="smcap">H</span>, which passes through <i>a b</i> and <i>c d</i>.
<i>a b</i> and <i>c d</i> are glued to a piece of stripwood <span class="smcap">F</span> (&frac14; inch by &frac14; inch)
which has its projecting ends rounded to receive two cardboard
wheels. The great fault of these earlier cannons was that though
they were often of immense bore and weight, throwing balls of
from one to five hundredweights, they were for the most part
without carriages, and therefore very difficult to move about and
very slow in their operations.</p>

<p>The Scots were the first to anticipate the modern gun-carriage
by what they called 'carts of war,' which carried two
guns. Many of the guns of the English required fifty horses to
drag them!</p>

<p><b>'Mons Meg'</b> (a fifteenth-century cannon still to be seen at

<p>Parts <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span> (Fig. 336) are drawn on cardboard, cut out and
coloured (brown and black). They are joined together by strips
of cardboard at <i>a b</i> and <i>c d</i>. To the cardboard at <i>a b</i> the cannon
is gummed. The wheels are of cardboard, the axle of stripwood
(&frac14; inch by &frac14; inch). Mons Meg fired a granite ball weighing 300 lb.</p>

<p><b>A Tudor Cannon</b> (Fig. 337). The sides <span class="smcap">A A</span> may be cut out
of cardboard or, better still, of three-ply wood with the fret-saw.
The wheels are solid discs
and may also be cut out
with the fret-saw, holes being
drilled in the centre for
the axle. The cannon itself
can be shaped out of wood
with pen-knife and file, or a
cardboard roll (such as is used
for transmitting music or
pictures) can be used, the thicker parts are then made by gumming
additional pieces of cardboard round it, or glueing strips of lead.</p>

<p>It is difficult to discover when gunpowder was first used. Probably
its use was learnt from the Saracens in the fourteenth century.
Roger Bacon (? 1214-1294) suggested that it might be used in
warfare.</p>

<p>In a Florentine document of 1326 mention is made of the use
of gunpowder in Europe. The first use of the cannon recorded
in English history is in 1327, when Edward III was at war with
Scotland.</p>

<p>In making the guns described in this chapter it is necessary to
distinguish between breech-loading cannons and muzzle-loading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>The breech-loader is loaded from the breech or rear end of the
barrel and not at the muzzle. Figs. 334, 335 and 337 are examples
of this kind and therefore must have a hole at each end.</p>

<p>Figs. 331 and 332 are examples of muzzle-loading cannons and
therefore have holes only at one end.</p>

<p>During the sixteenth century breech-loading was gradually
abandoned for muzzle-loading owing to the large escape of gas
and air at the breech. It was not until 1860 that it was reverted
to with great improvements.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 338</span></div>
</div>

<p><b>A Ship Cannon.</b> A piece of wood (about &frac14; inch thick, the side
of a wooden chocolate-box or any other light box will do) is first
sawn out 5&frac12; inches by 2 inches
(<span class="smcap">A</span> in Fig. 338). Another piece
of wood, <span class="smcap">B</span>, 4&frac12; inches by 2 inches,
is cut and glued on the first
piece. Three pieces of stripwood
&frac14; inch by &frac12; inch, <span class="smcap">C</span>, <span class="smcap">D</span>, <span class="smcap">E</span>,
are cut to lengths 3&frac12; inches,
2&frac34; inches, 2 inches respectively.
These are glued on one side
as in the figure, and similar strips are cut and glued to the
other side. Two pieces of stripwood, <span class="smcap">F</span>, &frac12;" &times; &frac12;" &times; 1&frac12;", have holes
drilled half way through them, to receive the
pivots of the gun, but must not be glued on to
<span class="smcap">E</span> until the gun is in position.</p>

<p>The cannon is made of a roll of brown paper
6 inches long; one end should be narrower than
the other (the widest end say 1 inch in diameter,
the narrowest end &frac12; inch to &frac34; inch).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_204b.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 339</span></div>
</div>

<p>The roll must be securely fastened together
by seccotine, two layers of brown paper make
a strong cannon; black paper is then pasted
over it and bands of brown paper as in
Fig. 339. A hole is pierced through the cannon
about half-way along it, and a round stick, <span class="smcap">K M</span>,
passed through; this pivot should be just long
enough to fit into blocks <span class="smcap">F</span> when these are fixed and glued
in position.</p>

<p>Before this is done, the wheels should be made and fastened on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
This is an easy matter. Two lengths of stripwood (&frac14; inch by &frac12; inch)
are cut 2&frac14; inches long. The little wheels (&frac34; inch in diameter) are
cut from any round rod available, or if no rod can be obtained
they may be cut out of cardboard. Holes are drilled in the wheels
and nails with large heads passed through and driven into the
stripwood. The axles are either glued or nailed to the bottom
of <span class="smcap">A</span>. Finally the pivot, <span class="smcap">K M</span>, is fitted into its blocks, and these are
glued into position. A wedge can be made to slip in under the
cannon to raise and lower it. The wedge should be just wide
enough to slip in between the two layers of stripwood.</p>

<p><b>A Modern Breech-loading Field Gun</b> (Fig. 341). This is a
simple toy to make. A piece of stripwood, <span class="smcap">A</span>, &frac14;" &times; &frac14;" &times; 2", must first
be cut, and the ends, <span class="smcap">B</span> and <span class="smcap">C</span>, rounded for about &frac12; inch (Fig. 340).
Next two pieces of stripwood, <span class="smcap">D</span> and <span class="smcap">E</span>, &frac14;" &times; &frac14;" &times; 1&frac14;", are cut.
These must have their tops rounded as in Fig. 341, and have
holes drilled through them to receive a rounded match, <span class="smcap">G</span>. <span class="smcap">F</span> is
a piece of wood &frac12;" &times; &frac14;" &times; 5/8". Pieces <span class="smcap">F</span>, <span class="smcap">D</span> and <span class="smcap">E</span> are glued or nailed
to <span class="smcap">A</span>. Before the pivot <span class="smcap">G</span> is put in position the cannon must be
made. This is a roll of black paper, 3&frac34; inches long, &frac12; inch in
diameter at widest end, and &frac14; inch at the narrowest. Holes
are made through it to receive the pivot. The ends of the
match sticks that project beyond <span class="smcap">D</span> and <span class="smcap">E</span> can be cut off. Next
the wheels are cut. These may be cardboard discs of diameter
1-3/8 inches.</p>

<p>A piece of wood, <span class="smcap">H</span>, is next cut, &frac12;" &times; &frac12;" &times; 4&frac12;", and worked to
the shape shown in Fig. 341. The end <span class="smcap">L</span> must be sawn at an angle,
so that when <span class="smcap">H</span> is glued on, <span class="smcap">D</span> is perpendicular. The end <span class="smcap">L</span> is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
glued to the piece of wood, <span class="smcap">F</span>. <span class="smcap">K</span> is a piece of cardboard with a
hole through it for pulling the cannon along; it is glued to end <span class="smcap">M</span>.</p>

<p>The wheels, etc., should be painted black or grey. The cannon
itself may be made of white paper and painted grey or yellow, or
else made of yellow or light brown paper.</p>

<p>A <b>Cart</b> must next be made to carry ammunition for the cannon.
The shells for the cannon described would be about 2&frac14; inches long,
so the cart must be 2&frac12; inches long, and 1&frac34; inches wide (Fig. 342).
It can be made of wood or cardboard. Notice the end to which
the lid is attached.</p>

<p>The wheels must be the same size as those used for the cannon
and can be made and attached in the same way to an axle, but
this axle must project some distance beyond the wheel, as in
Fig. 343, and have a groove filed round it, so that short chains
may be fastened on each side; ropes are attached to these chains
to allow the cart to be pulled along by hand.</p>

<p>Fig. 344 shows the shaft. It is 1&frac12; times the length of the cart.
It can be made of strips of cardboard or wood. Matches painted
black make good shells.</p>

A FIRE-ESCAPE (<span class="smcap">Plate XIV</span>)</h3>


<p>To make this toy, plenty of used matches are required, and
some strips of light wood (that obtained from a soap-box or
chocolate-box will do) and liquid glue.</p>

<p>Two lengths of wood, <span class="smcap">Q R</span> and <span class="smcap">S T</span>, are cut 12&frac12;" &times; &frac12;" &times; &frac14;", and one
long edge of each is rounded. These pieces are sand-papered if
they are rough or uneven.</p>

<p>Twenty-three pencil dots half an inch apart are marked down
the middle of the widest side of one piece. The two pieces are then
clamped together (the piece with the 23 marks on top), and holes
drilled through them both together with an Archimedean drill.</p>

<p>Next seventeen matches are taken, and cut exactly to the
length 1&frac34; inches; the ends are tapered so that they will fit in the
holes drilled. Beginning from one end of one long strip, hammer
these matches in the first seventeen holes, place the second long
strip of wood on top of these matches, so that the first seventeen
holes are exactly over the seventeen matches and hammer it on.
(Be careful to hammer in between the holes, a file makes a good
hammer.) Hammer first one strip, and then the other until the
matches are driven firmly in the holes, as far as they will go;
file away all projecting ends of matches. Through the eighteenth
hole of <span class="smcap">Q R</span> and <span class="smcap">S T</span>, a long piece of wood, <span class="smcap">A B</span>, must pass to project
1-1/3 inches on each side of the ladder (Fig. 345).</p>

<p>Two pieces of wood, 3&frac12;" &times; &frac12;" &times; &frac14;" (<span class="smcap">C D</span> and <span class="smcap">E F</span>), are cut, and have
six holes drilled in them; these six holes must be marked off from
the six remaining holes in the main ladder, so that they will
come exactly opposite them; these pieces are secured to the
main ladder by matches, and by the cross-piece, <span class="smcap">A B</span>. The whole
ladder is then glued to a strip of wood, <span class="smcap">G H</span>, &frac12; inch by &frac14; inch of
a length equal to the total width of the ladder. This can be
put aside for a time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>Next the shaft in Fig. 346 is made. <span class="smcap">K P</span> is the same length as
<span class="smcap">G H</span> in Fig. 345 and about &frac14; inch by &frac14; inch; <span class="smcap">K M</span>, <span class="smcap">L N</span>, <span class="smcap">O J</span>, <span class="smcap">P U</span>
are each 4&frac14; inches long, they are the same distances apart as
<span class="smcap">C G</span>, <span class="smcap">Q R</span>, <span class="smcap">S T</span> and <span class="smcap">E H</span> in Fig. 345. They are held together by strips,
<span class="smcap">V</span>, <span class="smcap">W</span>, <span class="smcap">X</span>, <span class="smcap">Y</span>, <span class="smcap">Z</span>. These strips may be matches; in this case they must
be inserted first, and then the whole of <span class="smcap">K M P U</span> is glued to <span class="smcap">K P</span>.</p>

<p>This shaft is fastened to the main ladder in Fig. 345 midway
between <span class="smcap">A B</span> and <span class="smcap">G H</span>, so that when the shaft is horizontal the main
ladder makes an angle of 72&deg; with it.</p>

<p>Fig. 347 shows the shaft <span class="smcap">M K</span>, <span class="smcap">P U</span>, attached to the main ladder;
it is supported in its place by four struts, two on each side (<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
in Fig. 347). Care must be taken to saw off the ends <span class="smcap">M</span>, <span class="smcap">N</span>, <span class="smcap">J</span>, <span class="smcap">U</span>
(Fig. 346) so that they rest exactly against <span class="smcap">C D</span>, <span class="smcap">R Q</span>, <span class="smcap">S T</span>, <span class="smcap">E F</span>
(Fig. 345), at about an angle of 72&deg;. The ends of the struts must
also be carefully bevelled to fit; the main ladder can then be glued
to the shaft and the struts to the main ladder and shaft.</p>

<p>Small wheels of cardboard or wood are nailed (as for ship's
cannon) at each end of <span class="smcap">G H</span>.</p>

<p>An axle for the larger wheels must be made to be glued on <span class="smcap">K P</span>
(Fig. 347). Care must be taken in deciding on the size of the large
wheels, the diameter must be such a length that the shaft, <span class="smcap">K M P U</span>,
is parallel to the ground.</p>

<p>Next the back portion shown on the plate is made similarly
to the shaft shown in Fig. 346. It is glued to <span class="smcap">G H</span> so as to be at
right angles to the main ladder. Pieces of wire bent and pushed
into holes in <span class="smcap">C D</span> and <span class="smcap">E F</span> form railings. Pieces of stout thread are
attached to strengthen the whole, as shown in the plate. An
extra ladder (necessarily narrower) can be made to rest on the
bar, <span class="smcap">X</span>, and lean inside a piece of bent wire as shown. The wheels
can be made of cardboard or sawn from any of the materials
suggested in Part I, Chapter XIII.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;In making the fire-escape it will be a help to cut out
two cardboard angles of 72&deg;, these help to keep the shaft <span class="smcap">K M P U</span>
in the right position while the glue is drying.</p>

<p>Divide this as in Fig. 350, and make half cuts along the dotted
lines. Cut out the windows. Fold and gum together. Make
the other towers in the same way.</p>

<p>To make overhanging battlements, cut pieces of stripwood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
&frac12; inch by &frac14; inch the correct length, and glue them round the tops
of the towers (Fig. 351). Then cut out pieces of cardboard as in
Fig. 352, and gum these to the wood. It is best to cut a strip of
cardboard long enough for two sides only, and to make a half cut
at the bend; then to cut another strip for the other two sides.
Small pieces can be cut off a length of stripwood, &frac14; inch by
&frac14; inch, and glued underneath, as <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, in Fig. 351.</p>

<p>Next make the sides, <span class="smcap">M</span>, <span class="smcap">N</span>, <span class="smcap">O</span>, <span class="smcap">P</span>; these are about 3 inches
in width, but a &frac12; inch must be allowed on each side for flanges
for fastening them to the towers; in height they just reach the
battlements of the towers. Make battlements as described, cut
out the windows and fasten these sides to the four towers. Colour
this part suitably. To make a flat roof for <span class="smcap">Q</span> (Fig. 349), cut eight
lengths of stripwood &frac14; inch by &frac14; inch just long enough to come
about &frac12; inch below the battlements of the sides, <span class="smcap">M</span>, <span class="smcap">N</span>, <span class="smcap">O</span>, <span class="smcap">P</span>, and glue
these into the eight corners of <span class="smcap">Q</span>. Cut a piece of cardboard to fit
over <span class="smcap">Q</span>, cut doors in this for access to the roof, and glue it to
the tops of the pieces of stripwood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>To make towers <span class="smcap">E</span> and <span class="smcap">F</span>. Cut a piece of cardboard, 7 inches
by 10 inches. Mark it out as in Fig. 353, and make half cuts
along the dotted lines; the narrow strips at each end are flanges
for fastening the tower <span class="smcap">E</span>, to <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">C</span>. Make battlements round
the top, colour, mark the windows and door, and gum to <span class="smcap">A</span> and
<span class="smcap">C</span>; make <span class="smcap">F</span> in the same way. <span class="smcap">G</span> and <span class="smcap">H</span> are similar towers 2&frac12; inches
square and 7 inches high. The four towers, <span class="smcap">E</span>, <span class="smcap">F</span>, <span class="smcap">G</span>, <span class="smcap">H</span>, can be
covered with roofs in the way already described. <span class="smcap">G</span> and <span class="smcap">H</span> are
fastened to <span class="smcap">E</span> and <span class="smcap">F</span> respectively, by pieces of cardboard 5 inches
long and about 4&frac12; inches high. <span class="smcap">G</span> is fastened to <span class="smcap">H</span> by <span class="smcap">L</span>, which
is about 7&frac12; inches long and 4&frac12; inches high. A door can be made
in <span class="smcap">L</span>, leading into the courtyard, <span class="smcap">Q</span>.</p>

<p>Cut a piece of cardboard, <span class="smcap">R</span> in Fig. 348, about 2-1/3 inches high,
and gum it to the side of <span class="smcap">E</span> to form a wall; between the latter
and tower a fit a flight of steps. These are marked out as in
Fig. 354.</p>

<p>Make half cuts along the lines marked&mdash;&mdash;; turn the cardboard
over and make half cuts on the other side along the dotted
lines; bend in alternate directions. Flanges may be added to
each step.</p>

<p>A <b>Tournament</b> (Plate XV). Fig. 355 shows a royal tent at
a tournament. The platform inside may be made of 12 match-boxes
(<span class="smcap">A</span>, <span class="smcap">B</span>, <span class="smcap">C</span>, <span class="smcap">D</span>, <span class="smcap">E</span>, <span class="smcap">F</span> show the six foremost ones) or of any
suitable cardboard box. Pieces of cardboard, <span class="smcap">G H K L</span> and <span class="smcap">M N O P</span>,
are gummed on each side. <i>a b c d</i> is a piece of cardboard gummed
to a match-box and placed in front of the opening between <span class="smcap">H L</span>
and <span class="smcap">M O</span>. Paper steps may be made to lead from the ground to
the top of the match-box, and thence to the top of the platform.</p>

<p>The roof, <span class="smcap">S</span>, is a piece of paper, bent along <span class="smcap">T V</span>, to fit the triangular
tops of the cardboard sides, <span class="smcap">Q</span> and <span class="smcap">R</span>, to which it is fastened
by paper hinges. A piece of cardboard is gummed at the back.
Flags, etc., may be added.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">X</span> and <span class="smcap">Z</span> show stands at the back for the more ordinary spectators.
They are simply strips of cardboard, suitably painted
and gummed for support to match-boxes or strips of wood.</p>

<p>The railings shown in the plate are made of cardboard or stripwood,
and placed in suitable positions to represent the lists.
If the railings are made of cardboard they should be fitted into a
groove in a piece of wood to enable them to stand.</p>

<p><b>A Fair in the Days of Henry VIII</b> (Plate XV). The plate
shows the background of the fair. It is a piece of cardboard, with
houses drawn upon it and coloured; behind it are fastened two
cardboard supports which enable it to stand upright. This piece
of cardboard should be as long as possible, to give plenty of room
for many booths to be placed in front of it. Fig. 360 shows a
booth at which cloth and woollen materials are sold.</p>

<p>The covering of the booth is made of paper. The tables may
be of different shapes in different stalls. In the cloth merchant's
stall, rolls of coloured paper are piled up to represent bales of
cloth. To the pole is tied a sheep cut out of cardboard. An
apothecary's booth with its red and white pole can be made.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
Shelves of cardboard, supported on little pieces of wood glued

and space <span class="smcap">C</span> is painted black. The grate is made of cardboard
(Fig. 367). The shaded portions are cut out and half cuts are
made along the dotted lines. It is coloured black, bent as in
Fig. 366 and gummed to the cardboard back. The fender is of
wood, and is glued to <span class="smcap">E</span> and <span class="smcap">F</span> and to a cardboard bottom, <span class="smcap">B</span>,
which is coloured to represent tiles.</p>

<p>The grate may also be made of pieces of wire bent to shape

<p><b>A Railway Signal.</b> Fig. 370 shows a simple method of making
this toy. <span class="smcap">A</span> is a piece of stripwood about 11" &times; &frac12;" &times; &frac14;", fastened to a
wooden stand. Holes are bored in <span class="smcap">A</span> at <span class="smcap">F</span> about &frac12; inch from the top
and at <span class="smcap">G</span> about 2&frac12; inches from the ground. The arm, <span class="smcap">C</span>, is a piece
of cardboard 3 inches by &frac12; inch with a red band painted across it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
The lever, <span class="smcap">D</span>, is a smaller piece of cardboard. <span class="smcap">C</span> and <span class="smcap">D</span> are fastened
to <span class="smcap">A</span> by pieces of wire or by rivets so that they move freely up
and down. <span class="smcap">B</span> is a narrow strip of stiff cardboard fastened by
small paper-clips to <span class="smcap">C</span> and <span class="smcap">D</span>. When the lever, <span class="smcap">D</span>, is pulled down,
the arm, <span class="smcap">C</span>, is pushed up. A small nail is put in at <span class="smcap">E</span> to keep the
arm from rising too high.</p>

<p>Fig. 371 shows a railway signal which can be worked by a
lever placed at any distance away.</p>

<p>In this model the arm, <span class="smcap">F</span>, is a piece of wood about 4" &times; &frac12;" &times; &frac14;".
Into one end is fixed a screw-eye, <span class="smcap">A</span>. About &frac12; inch from this end
bore a hole. Nail the arm through this hole to the post about
&frac34; inches from the top, so that it moves freely on the nail. <span class="smcap">B</span> is
a piece of wood, 2" &times; &frac12;" &times; &frac14;". Make three holes in it. Nail it
through the middle hole to the post, 3 inches from the ground,
so that it turns freely on the nail. Take a piece of fairly strong
wire, fasten one end to <span class="smcap">A</span> and the other to <span class="smcap">B</span>. A weight (a lead
button) is needed to keep the arm of the signal up. Attach this
weight, <span class="smcap">C</span>, by a piece of thread to <span class="smcap">B</span>, as in the figure. Tie a piece
of thread to <span class="smcap">D</span>, pass it through a small screw-eye, <span class="smcap">E</span>, fixed on the
stand. When this string is pulled the arm is lowered.</p>

<p>This toy may be worked entirely with thread. Tie a piece of
thread from <span class="smcap">A</span> to <span class="smcap">C</span>, taking care to keep the lever <span class="smcap">B</span> in the position
shown in the figure; then tie another piece from a small nail
at <span class="smcap">F</span> to <span class="smcap">D</span>. A small nail should be put in at <span class="smcap">G</span> to prevent the arm
from rising too high.</p>

<p>The stand and the shaded part of the signal post should be
painted black, the rest of the post is white, the arm is white with
a red band.</p>

<p><b>A Signal-box</b> (Plate VIII). For the foundation of the signal-box,
take a piece of wood 9 inches by 4 inches, <span class="smcap">A B C D</span> (Fig.
372). Cut two pieces of wood, 4&frac12; inches by 4 inches. Glue and
nail these to <span class="smcap">A B C D</span> (<span class="smcap">E</span> and <span class="smcap">F</span> in Fig. 372). Next cut four pieces
of wood, <span class="smcap">G H J K</span>, &frac14;" &times; &frac14;" &times; 6&frac12;". Glue these to <span class="smcap">E</span> and <span class="smcap">F</span>. Measure
and cut two pieces of wood, <span class="smcap">M</span> and <span class="smcap">L</span>, to fit in between <span class="smcap">K</span> and <span class="smcap">J</span>,
and <span class="smcap">G</span> and <span class="smcap">H</span>. Glue these in position. Next measure and cut
out a piece of cardboard, <span class="smcap">N</span> (Fig. 374), that will fit in between the
posts, <span class="smcap">G H J K</span>, and rest on the sides, <span class="smcap">E</span> and <span class="smcap">F</span>, and the ends,
<span class="smcap">L</span> and <span class="smcap">M</span>. This forms the floor of the signal-box.</p>

<p>Measure and cut two pieces of cardboard that will fit across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
the space between the posts <span class="smcap">G</span> and <span class="smcap">K</span>. Mark and cut out windows
in these as shown in the plate, and glue them on each side to the
posts. Next cut out two pieces of cardboard, 9 inches by 4 inches
(Fig. 375). Measure along the sides the distances <span class="smcap">C J</span> and <span class="smcap">K B</span>; find
the middle, <span class="smcap">O</span>, of top, join <span class="smcap">O K</span> and <span class="smcap">O J</span>, and cut off the shaded
portions. Make half cuts along the dotted lines and bend back
the flanges to which the roof is fastened. In one piece make a
door, the bottom of which must be on a level with the floor. A
window may be cut out in the door, or simply drawn in with
pencil and painted; on the other side, mark and cut out a window
similar to the window in the sides. Glue these pieces in position.
Make the roof of cardboard as described in the case of the Noah's

<p><i>The Porch.</i> For the platform of the porch cut a piece of wood
1&frac34; inches by 1&frac14; inches. Cut two sides, 2&frac34; inches by 1&frac14; inches.
Glue and nail these to the platform. Cut two supports as shown
in the plate, and glue these to the ends just underneath the
door, so that when the porch rests on them, and the door is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
open, the floor of the porch is level with the floor of the
signal-box. Next cut the two outer posts, glue them into position as
shown in the plate, and glue the platform of the porch on the
four posts. The roof of the porch is cut from cardboard, with
flanges to be glued to the end of the signal-box. The slope of
the roof should be parallel to that of the roof of the signal-box.</p>

<p>Make a ladder as described in Chapter IX. Bevel the ends
of the ladder as in Fig. 376 so that it can be glued into position.
Glue two small posts on each side and glue two strips of cardboard
to these and to the sides of the porch for railings.</p>

<p>Windows may be painted in the wooden sides, the rest is
coloured to represent bricks; the window sashes are dark green
or brown, and the roof grey.</p>

<p>From this signal-box the signal shown in Fig. 371 can be worked
in a very simple manner. Fig. 377 shows the arrangement.
Through a hole, <span class="smcap">A</span>, in the floor fits a wooden lever, <span class="smcap">B C</span>. Pass the
thread belonging to the signal through a small hole in the side of
the box, then through a small screw-eye at <span class="smcap">O</span>, and tie it to the end
of the rod. When the lever, <span class="smcap">B</span>, is pushed over the signal arm is
lowered.</p>

<p>A small nail is put through the lever just above <span class="smcap">A</span>, to act as a
fulcrum. The side <span class="smcap">F</span> (Fig. 377) may have large windows which
open to enable the child to insert his hand and push the lever.
If the signal-post is set up some distance away from the signal-box,
it may be found necessary to add another weight.</p>

LIGHTHOUSE, TRANSPORTER BRIDGE</h3>


<p><b>A Lighthouse</b> (Plate XVI). This lighthouse is similar to one
called the Gull Island Light in Newfoundland. It is a hexagonal
column and is therefore somewhat easier to make than a circular
structure.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_229_378.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 378</span></div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_229_379.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 379</span></div>
</div>

<p>The main column is 9 inches high, and each of the six faces is
2 inches. Cut out a piece of cardboard, of medium thickness,
9 inches by 12&frac14; inches (Fig. 378).
Divide it into six parts 2 inches
in width, leaving a flange &frac14; inch
wide at the end for fastening the
column together. Make half cuts
along the dotted lines. Cut out a
door and windows, and two holes,
<span class="smcap">G</span> and <span class="smcap">H</span>, &frac14; inch square. Fold
and gum together. The hexagonal
column above the first platform is
2&frac12; inches high, sides 2 inches;
that above the second platform
is 2 inches high, sides 1&frac12; inches.</p>

<p>Before folding and gumming
the top column, or lantern, together,
windows must be cut out.
It is easier to cut the windows
out completely and gum the bars
behind the openings. A door is
cut just above the first platform
as shown in the plate. The
top of the lantern is a hexagonal
pyramid 1&frac12; inches high, edges 2 inches. To make this, the length
of one of the sloping edges (as <i>a' d'</i> in Fig. 380) must be found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 266px;">

<img src="images/i_230_381.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 381</span></div>
</div>

<p>Draw a line <i>a b</i> (Fig. 381) 2 inches long. This is one edge of
the hexagonal base. On it make an equilateral triangle <i>a c b</i>.
This is the same as triangle <i>a' c' b'</i> in Fig.
380. At <i>c</i> (Fig. 381) draw <i>c d</i> at right
angles to <i>a c</i>; make <i>c d</i> equal to the
height of the pyramid&mdash;namely, 1&frac12; inches;
join <i>a d</i>; this is the length of one of the
sloping edges (<i>a' d'</i> in Fig. 380). With
radius <i>a d</i> describe a circle (Fig. 379).
Mark along its circumference the distance
<i>a b</i>, six times; join <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>, <i>b</i> to <i>c</i>, etc., and
join each point to the centre. Cut off the
shaded portions, leaving a flange for fastening,
and make half-cuts along the dotted
lines. Bend and gum together.</p>

<p>The first platform shown in the plate
is a circle of cardboard or wood, radius 3 inches. Holes are
made round the edge.</p>

<p>To this the upper column is fastened by paper hinges, unless
the columns have been provided with flanges at top and bottom.
Glue match sticks or pieces of cane, about 1 inch in length, into
the holes in the platform for railings, round which black thread
may be tied. Now fasten the whole to the main column so that
the sides coincide.</p>

<p>In the same way the lantern is fastened to the upper platform
and the latter to the upper column, after similar railings have been
made round the upper platform. Lastly the pyramidal top is fixed
on the lantern, by either paper hinges or flanges. Now cut a
piece of stripwood, &frac14; inch by &frac14; inch, of the right length, so that it
passes through the holes <span class="smcap">G</span> and <span class="smcap">H</span> in the lower column and projects
about 1/8 inch over the doorway; into this projecting end
screw a small screw-eye, pass a piece of string through it and bring
the ends inside the door. This is the pulley by means of which
goods are hauled up from the boat into the lighthouse. A ladder
can be made of matches (as described in Chapter IX); two
wire hooks are inserted at the ends, and it is hung to the
doorway.</p>

<p>The lighthouse can be coloured grey and fastened to a piece
of cardboard painted blue.</p>

<p><b>A Transporter Bridge.</b> The supports for this bridge, <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span>
(Fig. 382), are two small wooden Bovril boxes (those containing

<p>Take two lengths of stripwood, <span class="smcap">C</span>, <span class="smcap">D</span>, 2' &times; &frac12;" &times; &frac14;"; on to each
of these glue and nail a similar length of stripwood, &frac14; inch by &frac14; inch
(Fig. 383). Next the overhead trolley should be made (Fig. 384).
The axles <span class="smcap">G</span> and <span class="smcap">H</span> are about 3&frac12;" &times; &frac14;" &times; &frac14;". The wheels are made
of wood and can be cut from an old broom handle. Before these
are put on, the two pieces <span class="smcap">E</span> and <span class="smcap">F</span>, which are 3&frac12;" &times; &frac14;" &times; &frac14;", are
glued to <span class="smcap">G</span> and <span class="smcap">H</span>. <span class="smcap">C</span> and <span class="smcap">D</span> are placed so that the trolley runs
easily along their ledges, the distance between them is measured
and two pieces of stripwood (<span class="smcap">J</span> in Fig. 383) are cut, by means of
which <span class="smcap">C</span> and <span class="smcap">D</span> are fastened together. This frame can rest on
<span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span>. There is no need to fasten it permanently.</p>

<p>To each end of <span class="smcap">H</span> and <span class="smcap">G</span>, very small screw-eyes are screwed,
<span class="smcap">K</span> in Fig. 383, to which the strings or chains which support
the car are attached&mdash;also two screw-eyes are screwed in at
<span class="smcap">H</span> and <span class="smcap">G</span>.</p>

<p>Fig. 385 shows part of the car and gives the necessary measurements.
Side <span class="smcap">R</span> is made of stripwood, &frac14; inch by &frac14; inch. The gates
at each end are made of strips of cardboard. Four screw-eyes
are placed in the corner posts for hanging the car to trolley (see
Fig. 382). Pieces of thread are tied to the screw-eyes at <span class="smcap">H</span> and <span class="smcap">G</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
and pass through screw-eyes in the supports (<span class="smcap">T</span> and <span class="smcap">U</span> in Fig. 382).
Two windlasses can be made to stand on <span class="smcap">M</span> and <span class="smcap">L</span>, similar to the
winding gear described in making the crane (Chapter V), by
means of which the car can be drawn backward and forward. The

YACHTS AND BOATS; THE USE OF THE CHISEL</h3>


<p>For the toys described hitherto, the chisel has hardly been required,
but to carve boats from a solid block of wood it becomes
somewhat of a necessity, the pen-knife being but a poor substitute.
The use of the chisel has been postponed owing to the dangers
which attend its use. However, when children have become
accustomed to handle tools properly and to respect them, they
are no more likely to cut their hands with a chisel than with a
knife when sharpening pencils or peeling potatoes.</p>

<p>The following tools will be found useful in making exact
models of boats, hollowing them out, etc.:</p>

<p>(1) A &frac12;-inch or &frac34;-inch chisel. This is a good one to start with.</p>

<p>(2) A smaller chisel about &frac14; inch wide.</p>

<p>(3) A gouge. A 3/8 inch and a 5/8 inch gouge answer most purposes.
This is an indispensable tool when hollowing out a boat.</p>

<p>(4) A spoke-shave. This is used to smooth a curved surface
after it has been roughly cut with a chisel or knife. It is not really
necessary, as its work may be done with sand-paper or a file.
However it is not expensive, and it leaves the wood with a 'clean'
surface much superior to that obtained with sand-paper.</p>

<p>(5) A vice.</p>

<p>The best wood for making the following boats is <i>yellow deal</i>
or <i>American white-wood</i>. This, though not expensive, must be
bought. One does not often find a piece of waste wood suitable
for boat-making.</p>

<p>A very simple boat can be made in the following way. Procure
a block of wood about 7" &times; 1&frac12;" &times; 2". On the top surface of the block
draw a plan of the boat as in Fig. 387; on the bottom surface
draw the plan shown in Fig. 388. Take care not to make the keel
too narrow, especially in first attempts at boat-making. The keel
of this boat may be quite &frac14; inch thick. See that it is really in the
middle.</p>

<img src="images/i_236_390.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 390</span></div>
</div>

<p>Mark on both sides of the boat the lines shown in
elevation, Fig. 386. Mark lines showing the stern elevation
as in Fig. 389, at the other end the stern, as in Fig. 390.</p>

<p>Now saw away as much surplus wood as possible. It is well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
to begin by sawing along lines a b and <i>c d</i> in Fig. 387, to roughly
shape out bow. If a very curved bow is desired, saw off the corner
<i>e f g</i> (Fig. 386). To make the keel, saw along lines <i>a h</i> and <i>c k</i>,
about &frac14; inch deep (Fig. 388), at the stern end saw down to <span class="smcap">M</span> and <span class="smcap">N</span>.
Now carefully round and model the sides and keel with gouge,
chisel, spoke-shave and file, or simply with chisel and file.</p>

<p>Before finishing off with sand-paper or spoke-shave, the boat
should be tried in the water, it will probably lean to one side;
cut off a little wood from this side and try again. (Be careful
to dry your tools if they get wet.) When the boat is properly
balanced, nail a strip of lead along the keel.</p>

<p>A hole may be bored on the deck for a mast.</p>

<p><i>To make the Rudder.</i> Saw a piece of wood out about
1 inch by 2&frac14; inches (wood should be about &frac14; inch thick). Draw
a rudder on it as in Fig. 391, cut out this shape
with saw and file. Round the top as at <span class="smcap">C</span> for the
handle. Make holes with a fine bradawl and insert
two pieces of bent wire at <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. To put them
in it is best to hold them with a pair of pincers.
Ordinary pins with their heads cut off do just as
well as wire. Make two wire loops and fix them
in the stern of the boat (<span class="smcap">P</span> and <span class="smcap">Q</span> in Fig. 386), that
the rudder may hook on to these, care must be
taken that the eyes are exactly opposite the hooks.
To make the tiller, drill a hole in a piece of
wood, as in Fig. 392, and file it large enough to fit
tightly round the top of the rudder, then work the
tiller to shape.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 392</span></div>
</div>

<p>This boat can be hollowed out with the gouge.
First draw line <span class="smcap">R R R R</span> round the boat (Fig. 387)
to give the thickness of side. Before starting on the actual
boat, it is as well for the amateur to practise cutting a
few hollows. With satin walnut, pine, American white-wood,
gouging is not a difficult matter. When the boat is being
gouged out it should if possible be placed in a vice. (Always
put a piece of thin wood between the jaws of the vice and
the article you wish to hold to prevent marks.) Another way
of hollowing the boat is to begin boring centre-bit holes as
close together as possible, being careful not to bore too deep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
then gouge out as much wood as you safely can, finish with file and
sand-paper. When the boat is hollowed out, seats can be made for
it. These should be cut the exact length of middle of boat, bevelled
at the ends, and fitted into the boat by forcing them into position.</p>

<p>Figs. 393, 394, 395 show elevation and plans of a common
type of boat. Saw off triangular
pieces of wood to
form the bow, cut out the
stern with the tenon saw and
chisel. Model the sides and
keel with gouge, chisel and
file as before. To put a
rudder on this boat, notice
that a hole must be bored
through the deck for the
rudder to pass through.
There is no need in a boat
like this, or indeed in any
boat (when practice has
been attained), to saw out the keel, the gouge and chisel are
sufficient, but the sawing sometimes helps the beginner.</p>

<p><b>A Schooner</b> (Plate IV). On a suitable piece of wood (a square
prism, length 3&frac12;&frac12; times width) draw a line <i>a a</i> (Fig. 396) on the
surface through the middle from end to end. Then draw a line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
across the middle <i>b b</i>, and divide the surface in three by lines <i>c c</i>
and <i>d d</i>. Pencil out the deck as in Fig. 396. Now here is a piece
of advice that it is well to follow in all boat-making. To mark off
the deck make a cardboard template the shape and size of one
half, taken from the middle line, <i>a a</i>. Lay the template on one half
of the piece of wood and pencil round the edge. Then turn the
template over on the other side and pencil round the edge again.
In this way the shape of the deck is more accurate and both sides
are symmetrical, which is very important if the boat is to float
upright in the water. Now on the sides draw the elevation as in
Fig. 397.</p>

<p>Cardboard templates will also be found useful in getting the
cross-sections correct.</p>

<p>Now saw and file away the stern, <span class="smcap">D</span>, and the bow, <span class="smcap">E</span>, and chisel
away the sides and keel as described before. Fig. 398 shows the
appearance of the stern.</p>

<p>Having chiselled and filed the outside of the hull to correct
shape and exactly equal on both sides, gouge out the inside as
described before. Next make the deck from deal about 1/8 inch
thick, cutting it the exact size of the outline in Fig. 396. Before
fastening the deck, bore a hole at <span class="smcap">A</span> for the rudder (a corresponding
hole being bored in the hull), and holes at <span class="smcap">B</span> and <span class="smcap">C</span> for masts
(with corresponding holes, not more than &frac14; inch deep, in the hull).
If need be (in large models) the under part of the deck where holes
come can be strengthened by pieces of wood nailed across. With
a hard pencil draw lines along the deck to give the appearance
of boards.</p>

<p>A hole for a hatch-way may be cut out with a fret-saw. The
hatch-way itself for a large boat can be made of pieces of wood
nailed together.</p>

<p>Now fix the deck on to the top of the hull with small nails.</p>

<p>Another way of fixing the deck is to make it just large enough
to fit inside the hull, leaving an edge or bulwark all round,
&frac14; inch to &frac12; inch in depth.</p>

<p>The longer mast goes into hole <span class="smcap">B</span>. The total length of the
schooner is about 1&frac14; times the height of the mast above the deck.
The shorter mast goes into hole <span class="smcap">C</span> and is very little longer than
half the boat. The masts must fit firmly into the holes in the
deck and hull.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>To ballast the boat, nail a piece of lead along the keel. If too
large a piece is used at first, it can easily be reduced.</p>

<p>The rudder <span class="smcap">F</span> is cut out and fixed as already described.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H</span> in Fig. 396 shows where the end of the bowsprit comes.</p>

THE FRET-SAW</h3>


<p>The <b>Fret-saw</b> is a delightful tool, and very useful to the toy-maker.
It can be used for making wheels and the various jointed and
mechanical toys described in the following chapters.</p>

<p>In dealing with the fret-saw we have to consider (1) the saw-blades
and (2) the frame in which they are held. The saw-blades
are about five inches in length and are made of delicate steel wire
with correspondingly fine teeth. They are very cheap, being
commonly sold at about three halfpence to threepence a dozen,
and even less when purchased by the gross. They are supplied
in ten different grades, numbered from 00 to 8, proceeding from
fine to coarse. For the toys described in this book, Nos. 1, 2 and 3
will be found most suitable. To preserve the saw-blades from
rust, keep them in a wood or metal case. Upon the proper
tension of the saw-blade depends its action. To keep it taut, a
number of frames have been designed, the most practical being
one made of steel and varying in size from 12 inches to 18 inches
measuring from the saw-blade to the back of the frame. The
handle is of wood. The 12-inch size is the most suitable for
children.</p>

<p>Cheap frames can be obtained for sixpence halfpenny (smaller
ones even for fourpence). In the cheaper kinds the necessary
tension is obtained by drawing the arms slightly towards each
other when clamping the blade. The spring of the steel will then
keep the blade sufficiently taut. In the better-class frames (price
from two shillings upward) the tension is secured by the action
of a lever. Notice that the saws must be inserted with the teeth
pointing downward.</p>

<p><i>Holding and managing the Saw-frame.</i> The hand saw-frame
requires all the steadiness possible; the bend of the frame should
rest along the forearm, and against the shoulder if the frame be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
a long one, or under the shoulder if a short one. This prevents
the frame from swinging round.</p>

<p>The saw-blade will describe the arc of a circle as it passes
through the wood, and this dip is reduced to the minimum by
making <i>short strokes</i> instead of long ones. This is important
to remember. The amateur is sure to break a few saw-blades
at first, they are so fragile, indeed even in the hands
of an expert they have a precarious hold on life and can
only be expected to last a certain time. Fortunately they are
cheap.</p>

<p>The saw-blade must not be pressed on into the wood too
quickly; the wood is held to the table with the fingers, and every
part of the line to be cut is moved in due succession against the
cutting edge of the blade. Excessive energy will often cause the
blade to stick fast in the wood; in this case the blade must be
eased by gently working it up and down so that it does not cut
but frees itself. This method can be adopted when turning a sharp
corner; work the saw up and down (without cutting) until the
blade points in the right direction.</p>

<p>Very often the locking of the blade in the wood is due to
gummy or heavy wood, or to a twist in the saw-blade; this latter
cause can be prevented by the exercise of care in fixing the saw
in the frame.</p>

<p>Children should have the cheaper frames to practise with;
however they soon learn to manage them and in due course find
out that a saw-blade is really not so delicate as it looks. In
cutting out animals, etc., leave a piece of surplus wood round
the frailer parts as long as possible so that one has something to
hold without fear of breakage.</p>

<p>When an interior space has to be cut out (<i>e.g.</i> when cutting
away interior portions of wheels to make the spokes) a hole must be
made by means of the Archimedean drill to admit the saw; the
upper end of the saw is released from its clamp, passed through
the hole, and again fixed in position. The hole in all cases should
be bored as near as possible to a corner or point, as these are
convenient starting-places. A medium-sized drill point rather
than fine points should be used wherever space permits. Fine
points are apt to break. The drill stock must be held quite vertical
and revolved both when the point is entering the wood and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
it is being withdrawn. No pressure is required on the drill beyond
its own weight.</p>

<p>In making the various jointed animals, etc., in the following
chapters bifurcated nickel rivets are used, small-gauge. The
following are useful sizes:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sizes No. 14 6/16, 8/16, 10/16. (These are useful for jointed animals.)</p>

<p>Sizes No. 11 12/16, 14/16, 16/16. (These are used for the crane, etc.)</p>

<p>These rivets can be bought in boxes of assorted sizes.</p>

</div>

<p>Figs. 400 and 401 show how a jointed animal is riveted
together. When hammering the rivet open, its head should be
placed on a piece of metal (the clamp will do). Fig. 401 shows the
method of opening the rivet. <span class="smcap">A</span> represents the table, <span class="smcap">B</span> the clamp,
<span class="smcap">C</span> the head of the rabbit and its ears, <span class="smcap">D</span>, the rivet.</p>

LITTLE GYMNAST; DANCING CLOWN; ROCKING
ANIMALS</h3>


<p><b>Little Gymnast.</b> First the little gymnast must be drawn and
cut out. He can be made of cardboard of medium thickness and
paper-fasteners (Size 00) or better of three-ply wood and bifurcated
nickel rivets (Size No. 14-8/16).</p>

<p>First draw the body, <span class="smcap">A</span>, Fig. 402,
2&frac12; inches long. (The measurements
given are important, for unless the
limbs are in proportion the figure
will not work properly.) Make two
holes with the drill, if wood is being
used, as in Fig. 402.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_244.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 402</span></div>
</div>

<p>The arms, <span class="smcap">B</span>, are 2&frac14; inches long,
the hands must be large enough
to contain holes to carry a wooden
knitting needle (1/8 inch in diameter).
The upper part of leg, <span class="smcap">C</span>,
is 1&frac12; inches in length; the lower
part, <span class="smcap">D</span>, 1&frac12; inches. Make holes in
these parts as in the figure. Take
care that the holes are large enough
to hold the rivet or paper-fasteners
loosely, so that the limbs swing
about easily.</p>

<p>Now fasten all these parts
together. (For directions how to
hammer the rivets see the previous
chapter.)</p>

<p>Paint the figure in water colours if it is made of cardboard, if it
is made of wood it may be left unpainted, or painted in oil colours.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>Push a wooden knitting needle (about 1/8 inch in diameter)
through the holes in the hands, see that it fits tightly, add a little
glue if there is any danger of the needle slipping round inside the
holes.</p>

<p>Two pieces of stripwood, <span class="smcap">E</span>, are next sawn about 11" &times; &frac14;" &times; &frac12;".
These posts must have holes drilled in them near the top for the
knitting needle to pass through, and revolve freely. The posts
are nailed and glued to a base, the size of which will depend upon
the length of the bar which the gymnast turns upon.</p>

<p>Two or three gymnasts look well swinging together, or a
gymnast, a monkey and a clown. In this case 12" &times; 6" &times; &frac14;" makes
a good stand. The posts are supported by triangular supports.
On turning the knitting needle the little figure will revolve in a
life-like manner, and perform many of the professional exercises
of the horizontal bar. The actions are made more realistic if
the man's head is weighted with a piece of lead, so as to make his
head more nearly the same weight as his body.</p>

<p><b>The Dancing Clown.</b> Draw on cardboard or three-ply wood
and cut out the head and body of the clown as in Fig. 403. Colour
it, and cut out another piece exactly the same to represent the
back of the clown. Draw and cut out two arms as in Fig. 404,
two legs as in Fig. 405. Cut out two small discs of lead, and glue
them behind the balls in his hands; glue little pieces of lead behind
his boots. His arms and legs are fastened together by thread,
as in Fig. 406. The back part of the body hides the strings.</p>

<p>This clown can be hung inside a box, and the strings passed
through a hole (directly underneath the clown) in another box
upon which he can then be made to dance, as in Fig. 407. The
figure works best if properly balanced; see that the arms and legs
are equal in size and weight.</p>

<p><b>Rocking Horses and Elephants.</b> The simplest way of making
a rocking horse is shown in Fig. 408. Two rockers, <span class="smcap">A B C</span>, are cut
out of cardboard (medium thickness). Next two horses, <span class="smcap">D</span>, are
drawn on cartridge paper, the distance between the fore and hind
feet corresponding to the distance <span class="smcap">A C</span> in the rockers. The
horses are coloured and cut out, and their heads and tails gummed
together. The four legs are then fastened with paper-fasteners
(or with gum) to the ends of the two rockers. A wooden rocking
horse is made in the following way. The two rockers, <span class="smcap">A B</span> and <span class="smcap">C D</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
are cut out of three-ply wood with a fret-saw. The arc of a circle
of 4 inches to 4&frac12; inches radius is a good size; width of rocker,
<span class="smcap">H K</span> (Fig. 409), &frac34; inch.</p>

<p>Three pieces of stripwood &frac14; inch by &frac14; inch are sawn, length
3&frac14; inches, <span class="smcap">E</span>, <span class="smcap">F</span> and <span class="smcap">G</span>. Pencil-marks must be made on the two
rockers to show where these strips are to go, one in the middle,
the other two at the ends. Before fastening them on, a slit is
sawn in the middle of each end-piece, as at <span class="smcap">E</span> and <span class="smcap">G</span>.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 410</span></div>
</div>

<p>Strips <span class="smcap">E</span>, <span class="smcap">F</span> and <span class="smcap">G</span> are glued and nailed to one rocker, then this
rocker can be laid on its side, and the second rocker glued to the
upstanding strips. There is no need to nail the second rocker;
indeed, if the ends of the strips are very evenly cut, there is no
need for nailing at all. The horse (Fig. 410) can be cut out of
cardboard and have one front leg and one back leg fitted into the
slits. Cardboard of medium thickness will just fit a saw-cut and
no gluing is needed. If the horse is cut out of fret-wood or three-ply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
wood (1/8 inch thick) the saw-cuts must be enlarged with a
file and the feet glued in.</p>

<p>Instead of horses, donkeys, tigers, lions, etc., can be fixed on
rockers as just described.</p>

<p>The rockers in Fig. 409 can also be built up of cardboard.</p>

<p><b>A Rocking Elephant.</b> On a piece of cardboard draw a circle
1&frac14; inches in radius; on this draw an elephant as in Fig. 411.
Colour the ball red and the elephant grey (both sides must be
coloured) and cut out. Cut out a piece of cartridge paper (Fig. 412),
length equal to half the circumference of the circle in Fig. 411,
width, 1&frac12; inches. Fold in half along <span class="smcap">D E</span>, cut out <span class="smcap">D B C E</span>, as in
diagram, the shaded portions being cut away. Gum <span class="smcap">B D C E</span> to
disc <span class="smcap">H</span> as in Fig. 411, so that <span class="smcap">D F E G</span> forms a rocker; make a
similar rocker for the other side. Two pieces of lead (<span class="smcap">A</span> in Fig.
411) are cut out and glued on each side of the disc at the bottom,
as in the figure. The lead must have paper suitably coloured pasted
over it. The elephant will swing up and down at the slightest
touch. Instead of an elephant a clown can be drawn on the ball.</p>

<p>Fig. 413 shows an elephant rolling on his back. This toy can
be made in the same way as the first elephant. A circle (1&frac14; inches
radius) is drawn first, and the elephant drawn in the circle.
These elephants can be cut with the fret-saw from satin walnut
(&frac14; inch thick). In this case the lead on each side must almost
reach the diameter, as shown in Fig. 413. Another disc of wood
(1&frac14; inch radius) must be fret-sawed out of the satin walnut, sawn
in two, and the halves glued one on each side of the lead, to make
a base wide enough for the toy to rock upon without upsetting.
No lead will then show, and it will look like a wooden toy. If
these toys are cut out of thin wood, 1/8 inch thick, they still require
at least twice as much lead as the cardboard toy.</p>

<p>The elephant may also be drawn balancing a ball instead of a
clown.</p>

<p>Children will delight in making these toys from cardboard,
paper and lead for a toy circus.</p>

<p>Fig. 414 shows a swan drawn in a circle; the shaded part
represents the paper rocker on one side. This model requires
no lead. A duck can be made in the same way.</p>

<p>Fig. 415 shows a design for elephants on a see-saw. The
elephants must be the same size as far as possible.</p>

MOVING FIGURES</h3>


<p>Fig. 416, "The Washing Day," shows a pattern that will please
little English toy-makers. It can be cut from wood with the
fret-saw, or with scissors from cardboard of medium thickness.</p>

</div>

<p><i>To make the Design.</i> First cut two lengths of three-ply wood
or cardboard, &frac12; inch by 8 inches, <span class="smcap">A B</span> and <span class="smcap">C D</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>Next draw on wood or cardboard, and cut out, the two little
washer-women (they are about 4&frac12; inches high). They look more
effective if painted.</p>

<p>These are fastened to the strips of cardboard by means of
paper-fasteners (Size 000; one gross sixpence); the holes for the
fasteners are about 1&frac14; inches from the ends. The holes in the
little washer-women are exactly one above the other, so that
when the paper-fasteners are in and <span class="smcap">A B</span> is exactly above <span class="smcap">C D</span>, the
figures are upright.</p>

<p>A washing tub, <span class="smcap">E</span>, is cut out of cartridge paper (top of tub,
3 inches, bottom 1&frac34; inches); this can be painted brown or green
and have a white rim round the top to represent soap-suds. This
tub is gummed to <span class="smcap">C D</span>, exactly between the two little washers.
If the part of <span class="smcap">A B</span> that comes behind the tub is cut away as in
diagram the figures will work better.</p>

<p>When the strips of cardboard are moved backward and
forward the figures put their clothes in the tub and take them
out again. The toy works best if a little space is left between
<span class="smcap">A B</span> and <span class="smcap">C D</span>, as in Fig. 417. If it is cut out of fret-wood the figures
are fastened by rivets, as explained in Chapter XV.</p>

<p>Fig. 417 shows two ducks eating out of the same bucket;
strips of cardboard, <span class="smcap">A B</span> and <span class="smcap">C D</span>, are the same size as those in
Fig. 416. The bucket is cut out of cardboard and gummed
to <span class="smcap">C D</span>.</p>

<p>The sailors in Fig. 418 are made in the same way, holes are
made in their hands, through which yarn is passed (the thicker
the yarn the more like rope it is) or oars can be cut out of cardboard
and fitted in the holes in their hands, when they will appear
to row.</p>

<p>Fig. 419 shows a man driving a donkey. It is made of cardboard,
except the whip, <span class="smcap">A</span>, which is thread tied into a hole in the
cardboard at <span class="smcap">C</span>. The whip will work better if a little piece of
lead or something heavy is tied at the end of the thread. The
reins, <span class="smcap">B</span>, are of thread or yarn, and pass through holes in the
donkey's mouth and in the man's hand.</p>

<p>Two fishermen can be made in the same way, the whip easily
becomes a fishing-rod and a lead fish can be attached to the end
of the line.</p>

<p>In the case of the donkey-driver and the fishermen the strips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
of cardboard should be longer than shown in the figure, to leave
room for holding. The strip for the donkey-driver should be
about 9 inches, the fishermen require at least 12 inches if their
lines are not to get entangled.</p>

SOME OLD-FASHIONED TOYS&mdash;A MONKEY-UP-A-STICK,
A JACK-IN-THE-BOX</h3>


<p>A Monkey-up-a-stick is a very easy toy to make. First cut out
a cardboard or wooden monkey as in Fig. 420. See that the legs
and arms turn freely on paper-fasteners, <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span>. Paint the
monkey grey or brown. With a pin make holes, <span class="smcap">C</span> and <span class="smcap">D</span>, in
the feet and hands. Next saw two lengths of stripwood, one
1&acute; &times; &frac14;" &times; &frac14;", the other almost twice as long. Drill a hole near
one end of each of these sticks. Pass a pin or piece of wire through
the holes in the monkey's feet and the hole in the shorter stick;
bend down the pin on each side to keep the feet from slipping off.
(The point of the pin should be cut off with pliers.) In the same
way fasten the monkey's hands to the longer stick. See that the
limbs (note that they come one on each side of the stick) revolve
freely on the pins or wire. The two sticks may be kept together
by pieces of elastic; this however rather prevents the one stick
from moving freely up and down the other. It is better first to
file the sticks (or one of the sticks) round or to use dowel rods.
These round rods can then be kept together by cardboard or
wooden discs. The disc must have a hole in the middle large
enough for the rod to move freely up and down in it. The
thicker the piece of wood or cardboard the better. The hole must
be made in the wood with a brace and bit (a bradawl will make
the hole in cardboard, and it can be filed to the right size with a
round file). The longer rod, <span class="smcap">A</span>, Fig. 421, goes through the hole;
the bottom of the shorter rod, <span class="smcap">B</span>, is glued and nailed to the disc.</p>

<p>By moving the disc <span class="smcap">C</span> up and down the monkey performs its
usual antics at the top of the stick.</p>

<p>The monkey, or a clown if preferred, looks very effective cut
out of three-ply wood and riveted together.</p>

<p>For a small model wooden meat skewers may be used as sticks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Other suggestions for <span class="smcap">C</span> in Fig. 421 are: a reel (though rod B
when glued to a reel tends to break off); half a cork.</p>

<p>More interesting than the "monkey-up-a-stick" is the
monkey that climbs a rope, though this little animal has sometimes
an irritating manner of swinging about on the rope, and
going no higher. If he is carefully made according to the following
directions he ought to climb. The monkey is cut out of cardboard
in the same way as the first monkey, except that his two
arms are gummed firmly on in the position shown in Fig. 422,
his legs only being free to move. Pins or pieces of wire are passed
through the holes at <span class="smcap">A</span>, <span class="smcap">B</span>, <span class="smcap">C</span>, <span class="smcap">D</span>. In the case of pins, the point is
cut off with cutting pliers and the rest doubled back to prevent
its coming out on one side, the head of the pin prevents it coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
out on the other. Tie a piece of thin elastic round the pins,
<span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span>, so that it is only just on the stretch when the legs are
drawn up parallel with the arms, as in the figure. A piece of wire
is passed through at <span class="smcap">E</span> and is bent over out-wards, drawing the
hands fairly tightly together. A piece of thread is passed through
the eye so formed, down and under the pin, <span class="smcap">C</span>, then over the pin, <span class="smcap">D</span>
By alternately slackening and tightening the line the monkey will
climb up the thread in a very life-like manner.</p>

<p>Care must be taken to nip the wire well together at the hands
to get enough friction to hold the thread firmly while the elastic
pulls the legs up, on the other hand the thread must be just loose
enough to pass through <span class="smcap">E</span>.</p>

<p><b>A Jack-in-the-box.</b> The simplest way of making a Jack-in-the-box
is the following. Get some ordinary wire (quite thin
wire will do) about 4 feet long or longer if a bigger jump is
required. Wind this tightly round a broom handle, keeping the
rings of wire close together. Slip it off. Take a cork, cut it so
that it is about 1&frac14; inches high. File it round in the shape of a
head as in Fig. 423. Mark the eyes and nose in ink, the mouth
with red paint; or two beads can be glued in for the eyes. To
make the hair, cut several short pieces of black wool, tie them
in the middle at <span class="smcap">B</span>, and glue or pin them to the middle of the head;
tie back the side ends with yellow or red wool as in the figure.
Fasten one end of the wire spring in the centre of bottom of cork,
as at <span class="smcap">A</span>. A piece of muslin is then gummed round the cork to hide
the spring, so that it is loose and folds easily.</p>

<p>Next make a box, 2&frac34; inches high, or take the cardboard box
that contains a bottle of Le Page's liquid glue, and cut off about
one-third. Cut off the cover and glue it on to one side (<span class="smcap">C</span> in the
figure). Make loop of wire at <span class="smcap">D</span>, and insert a paper-fastener at
<span class="smcap">E</span> to catch the wire loop. Fasten the end of the spring to the
bottom of the box, by passing it through the hole in one bottom
flap, bending it over and gluing over it the other flaps that form
the bottom. Coloured paper or scraps may be gummed to the
sides and top of the box. This is a suitable toy to be hung on a
small Christmas tree.</p>

<p>A larger and stronger Jack-in-the-box can be made from a
wooden box about 5&frac12; inches square. For this a piece of No. 12
gauge wire about 10 feet long is required; it is wound around a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
rolling-pin. This spring is then nailed by means of staples to a
piece of wood made to fit the inside of the box. Fasten a round
piece of cardboard to the top of the spring, and either sew on to it
a small doll's head, or make a doll's head of part of a stocking
stuffed with wool and having eyes, mouth, etc., sewn on. A cap
(a fool's cap looks best) is made to fit the head, and a loose jacket
is sewn on to hide the spiral body.</p>

LITTLE SWORDSMEN</h3>


<p>Fig. 424 shows the principle on which this toy is made; the
shaded portion represents the inside of a box. A good size for a
box to make this toy is 9" &times; 4&frac12;" &times; 2&frac14;". Slits should be cut in the
long side of the box at <i>a b</i>, <i>c d</i>, <i>e f</i>, <i>g h</i>. These slits may be made
with a pen-knife, and a fret-saw file will make them wide enough
for a piece of cardboard to slip up and down in.</p>

<p>Slits are then made in the short side exactly under the
long slits, as <i>p n</i> in Fig. 425. Widen these slits also with a
file.</p>

<p>Next cut out the cardboard figures. Draw head, body and
one leg to be cut out in one piece; about 3 inches of cardboard
should be left below the foot (<span class="smcap">M</span> and <span class="smcap">N</span> in Fig. 424), the total length
of figure being about 8 inches. Cut out another figure like this.
Make holes just below the foot as at <span class="smcap">D</span> in Fig. 424.</p>

<p>Next draw and cut out legs, <span class="smcap">F</span> and <span class="smcap">H</span>. Notice that they do not
project so far inside the box, their length being about 3&frac12; inches.
Fasten these to the figures by paper-fasteners. Next cut out a
long strip of cardboard, <span class="smcap">A B</span>, &frac12; inch by 14 inches. Pass this through
the slits (<i>p n</i> in Fig. 425) in the short sides of the box. See that
it slides easily up and down in these slits.</p>

<p>The portions marked <span class="smcap">M</span> and <span class="smcap">N</span> turn on pivots <i>h k</i> and <i>m l</i>.
These pivots pass through holes, <span class="smcap">D</span> and <span class="smcap">E</span>, in the figures and through
holes made at each side of the box exactly opposite the short
slits. Steel knitting needles make good pivots, or pieces of cane.
When the top is quite complete these pivots may be glued into
the holes in the box for greater security. Fasten pieces of lead
at the bottom of <span class="smcap">M</span> and <span class="smcap">N</span> so that the figures swing easily on the
pivots.</p>

<p>When it is found that the pivots are in the right place, pass
the strip of cardboard <span class="smcap">A B</span> through the slits, and fasten the legs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">F</span> and <span class="smcap">H</span>, to it by paper-fasteners, as at <span class="smcap">X</span> and <span class="smcap">Y</span>. See that the
needles are in the right holes and fasten up the box.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_258_424.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 424</span></div>
</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_258_425.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 425</span></div>
</div>

<p>(It is a convenience in making this toy to let the cover form
one side, the cover being left off until all the inside arrangements
are complete; the pivots can then be put into their holes in the
cover, and the cover put on.)</p>

<p>Now if the projecting ends of <span class="smcap">A B</span> are pushed backward and
forward the figures fight in a very realistic manner. Notice that
<span class="smcap">A B</span> has two movements: one backward and forward, the other
up and down. The lead weights in <span class="smcap">M</span> and <span class="smcap">N</span> keep <span class="smcap">A B</span> up. Generally
speaking, the longer the slits are the better the figure works.
This, however, does not apply to slits <i>c d</i> and <i>g h</i>. The slits need
not be so close together as in the figure if it is desired that the
swordsmen should fight at a greater distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>The arms are cut out of cardboard and fastened by paper-fasteners
on each side of the figure; the swords may be cut out
with the arms, or made separately and gummed on after-wards,
pieces of cane making effective swords. A more difficult but more
satisfactory way of putting on the arms is this: pass a very short
piece of cane through the hole in the body, where the arms are
to be fastened; see that it turns very easily in the hole; next
seccotine the pieces of cane that project at each side into holes in
the arms; see that one arm is up, the other down. To make the
arms balance well, it may be necessary to fasten a small piece of
lead to one hand.</p>

<p>This toy is most amusing if carefully made. The following
hints may be useful:</p>

<p>(1) Draw and paint the little swordsmen as carefully as
possible.</p>

<p>(2) See that the slits are perfectly straight and wide enough
for the cardboard to pass through.</p>

<p>(3) See that the arms, legs and feet turn easily on their pivots,
whether these pivots be paper-fasteners, cane or knitting needles.</p>

<p>(4) See that sufficient lead is attached.</p>

<p>(5) Cover the box neatly with paper, but <i>not</i> the slits. A piece
of green paper looks well for the top.</p>

<p>This toy may also be cut out of wood with a fret-saw. Many
other amusing toys can be made on the same principle.</p>

SOME MORE FRET-SAW TOYS</h3>


<p>Besides the numerous models already described that can be made
with the fret-saw, endless further toys might be made, among
others the following.</p>

<p>1. <b>A Zoo or Wild-Beast Show.</b> The animals for this may be
jointed models like the elephant and giraffe (Part I, Chapter XX);
in this case they will stand quite well; or they may be cut in one
piece and glued to an oblong strip of wood for a stand, as the lion
and other beasts in Figs. 426 to 430. Three-ply wood or satin
walnut 1/8 inch thick is suitable for these animals, which however
may also be cut out of cardboard and glued into slits cut in a
wooden stand.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_261.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 429</span></div>
</div>

<p>2. <b>Forest, Jungle or Desert Scenes, etc.</b> (Figs. 431 to 437).
These trees, which have very characteristic shapes, can easily be
cut out with the fret-saw. Where the branches are slender and
there is danger of their breaking, use three-ply wood. They
should be painted green, with the markings indicated in the
drawings put in with sepia or dark green.</p>

<p>3. <b>A Farmyard</b>, with trees, ducks, cows, etc. Figs. 438 to
443 are patterns of farmyard animals. There is considerable
educational value in the drawing and cutting out of the simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
outlines necessary in fret-wood trees or animals. It will help
children to think in lines, as it were, and to draw boldly.</p>

<p>Teachers will find sets of fret-wood animals and trees of use in
the Nature Study and Geography lessons.</p>

<p>4. <b>Soldiers, Sailors, Boy Scouts, etc.</b> Figs. 444 to 447 may
be cut out and glued on stands in the same way.</p>

<p>The small files used for fret-wood are useful to finish and
'clean up' these toys.</p>

TOYS WORKED BY SAND</h3>


<p>For these toys a wooden box is required, <span class="smcap">A B C D</span> (Fig. 448), about
a foot or more square and 5 inches deep. <span class="smcap">L</span> is a wheel made like
the overshot water-wheel in Chapter VI. Another way of making
the buckets is shown in Figs. 449, 450, and 451. These are glued
close together between two circles of cardboard as shown in
Fig. 451. This method is somewhat easier if small wheels are
required. The wheel should have ten or more buckets; the
greater the number of buckets, the faster the wheel works.</p>

flanges for fastening it to roof <span class="smcap">A B E F</span> (Fig. 448). A round hole
is filed out at <span class="smcap">A</span>, after the reservoir is fastened together, through
which the sand runs. The wooden side of box, <span class="smcap">A B E F</span>, is taken off
and a piece of cardboard is nailed to the box instead. This can
have a hole cut in it, <span class="smcap">K</span> in Fig. 448, and the reservoir glued under
it. <span class="smcap">G H</span> is a bar of stripwood nailed across the front of the box,
through which a hole, <span class="smcap">N</span>, is bored. The axle of the wheel passes
through this and through a corresponding hole in the back of the
box. As the sand runs out of the reservoir, it falls into the boxes
and so turns the wheel; hence the sails of a windmill, the hands
of a clock, etc., fastened to axle, <span class="smcap">L M</span>, can be made to turn. Notice
carefully that the hole at the bottom of the reservoir should be
over the centre of the boxes of the sand-wheel and a little to one
side of the wheel, as in Fig. 448. Part of the back of the box,
<span class="smcap">P Q R O</span>, should be cut out to allow a tray to go in to receive the
sand.</p>

<p><b>To make a Bicyclist</b> (Fig. 453). Cut two circles of cardboard,
radius 1&frac14; inches. Mark on them the spokes of a bicycle.</p>

<p>Make two sand-wheels the same size as the bicycle wheels;
their width should be about &frac12; inch to &frac34; inch. Take a piece of stripwood
&frac12; inch by &frac14; inch and the length of the box. Make holes
in it, 3 inches, 4&frac12; inches and 6 inches from one end. Nail the bar
across the box 3 inches from ground; make holes in the back of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
the box exactly opposite the holes in the bar. Make wooden axles
to pass right through these holes so that they turn freely in them.
The sand-wheels should be glued to two of these axles. Now cut
out a piece of cardboard to fit over the front of the box; bore
holes in it corresponding to those in the bar, <span class="smcap">G H</span>. Paint on it
a suitable background, as in Fig. 453. Nail small pieces of stripwood,
&frac12; inch by &frac14; inch, to the corners of the box (as at <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span> in
Fig. 453), to which the cardboard can be fastened by drawing-pins
or glue. Pass the axles of the sand-wheels through the first
and third holes from the end of bar <span class="smcap">G H</span>, and let them project
about 1 inch beyond the cardboard. To these ends the bicycle
wheels must be glued. In making this toy it is better not to
fasten pieces together too quickly, until all the various parts
are ready.</p>

<p>The figure of the cyclist should be cut out to the measurements
given for the little gymnast in Chapter XVI. The body
and head could be cut out of thin three-ply wood, and the arms
and legs of cardboard.
The best
method of joining
limbs to the body
so that there is
the least possible
friction is as
follows. Cut off
a small piece of
a pin, including
the head, pass it
through the holes,
and apply to the
cut end a tiny
drop of sealing
wax. Make holes
in the cyclist's
feet at <span class="smcap">G</span> (Fig. 454). Cut a small cardboard wheel, <span class="smcap">F</span>, about
&frac12; inch in diameter: make a hole in its centre and one near the
circumference.</p>

<p>Glue a piece of match stick into the hole near the circumference,
the other end of this match stick must turn freely in the hole in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
cyclist's left foot. Pass the axle already made through this
wheel, to which it must be glued, and through the cyclist's right
foot and through middle hole in the bar.</p>

<p>Make two small pulley wheels (<i>e.g.</i> slices of reels with cardboard
flanges), one twice the size of the other. Fig. 455 shows
how the toy is put together and how it works. <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span> are the
sand-wheels; axles, <span class="smcap">F G</span> and <span class="smcap">F M</span>, are glued into them and into the
two bicycle wheels. <span class="smcap">K H</span> is the axle passing through centre of
pedal wheel. <span class="smcap">N O</span> are pulley wheels glued to axles, <span class="smcap">F G</span> and <span class="smcap">H K</span>,
respectively, and connected by an elastic band, <span class="smcap">E</span>. When sand-wheel,
<span class="smcap">A</span>, turns round, wheel, <span class="smcap">N</span>, turns and turns pedal wheel, <span class="smcap">F</span>,
in Fig. 456, and as <span class="smcap">O</span> is twice as big as wheel <span class="smcap">N</span>, the pedal will
revolve twice as slowly as the bicycle wheels.</p>

<p>Pulleys of equal size, <span class="smcap">C</span> and <span class="smcap">D</span>, might be added with advantage
to connect the two sand-wheels, and a handle at <span class="smcap">F</span> to start the
wheels.</p>

<p>Fig. 456 shows how the leg is fastened to the pedal wheel.
To keep the cyclist's body steady cut a piece of stripwood
1" &times; &frac14;" &times; &frac14;". Glue one end to middle of cyclist's body and the
other to the cardboard background.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B</span> (Fig. 454) is a thin piece of wood, passing over the projecting
end of axle of wheel, <span class="smcap">E</span>, its other end being glued to the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
of the cyclist's body. A similar strip, <span class="smcap">A</span>, is cut. This is fastened
between his hands by a little piece of pin, and passes over the axle
of wheel, <span class="smcap">D</span>. <span class="smcap">C</span> is a thin strip of wood or cardboard which passes
over the axle of <span class="smcap">E</span> and can be glued to the cyclist's right leg and
pass behind wheel, <span class="smcap">F</span>.</p>

<p>Make a platform as in Fig. 453 to support the cyclist. Make
two reservoirs as already described. Cut a piece of cardboard
to fit over the top of box and make holes in it, <span class="smcap">L</span> and <span class="smcap">M</span> in Fig. 453.
Glue the reservoirs under these. Make a cardboard tray to fit
under the wheels for the sand to fall in. Another wheel might
be added to work the sails of the windmill in the distance. Very
fine sand must be used for working these toys, the best is silver
sand and it should be kept as dry as possible.</p>

<p>Fig. 457 shows another modification of this toy. <span class="smcap">B</span> is a box
turned upside down and placed in front of that containing the
sand-wheel. <span class="smcap">A</span> is the cardboard background, suitably coloured.
The sailor's legs are cut in one piece and glued into a slit in the
box. The body is fastened to them at <span class="smcap">F</span> by a small paper-clip so
that it moves very freely. The arm is fastened on at <span class="smcap">G</span>. A small
match stick passes through the hole in the hand and is glued in
the hole in circumference of wheel <span class="smcap">E</span>.</p>

<p>The axle, <span class="smcap">M N</span>, to which this wheel is glued passes through the
cardboard or wooden standard, <span class="smcap">D</span>, through a hole in the background,
<span class="smcap">A</span>, and through the centre of the sand-wheel. <span class="smcap">D</span> is fixed
to the box. The arm of the crane, <span class="smcap">C</span>, made of cardboard or three-ply,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
is glued to <span class="smcap">D</span>. A hole is made at <span class="smcap">G</span> and a corresponding hole
in <span class="smcap">A</span> opposite <span class="smcap">G</span>. Pass a small stick of wood or cane, <span class="smcap">K</span>, through
these holes and glue it in. The crane should be about 1 inch from
the background. <span class="smcap">K</span> keeps the arm of the crane steady. Tie a
piece of cotton to the axle of wheel <span class="smcap">E</span>, pass it over <span class="smcap">K</span> or over a
small pulley wheel revolving on <span class="smcap">K G</span>; tie to it a thin wire hook to
which a paper box or barrel can be fastened.</p>

TOYS WORKED BY WHEELS, ETC.</h3>


<p>Fig. 458 shows how a clown can be mounted on a cart so that
when the cart is drawn along he dances and waves his arms. In
toys of this kind, the wheels should be quite half-an-inch in thickness.
They are glued on to round axles which turn freely in
small screw-eyes or in holes in wooden blocks fastened under the
car or cart. If any part of the axle projects beyond the wheel
it gets in the way of the wires. The clown is made of cardboard
or three-ply, according to design given in Chapter XVI. It is
then fastened securely to rod <span class="smcap">B</span>, and the latter glued into a hole
in the middle of the cart. Fairly strong wire is fastened to the
wheel by a nail with a broad head so that when the wire is looped
round the nail it turns freely on the nail but does not come off.
The wire is bent at right angles twice to bring it close to the figure,
as shown at <span class="smcap">A</span>. It must fit accurately into the holes in the figure.
Notice that one leg passes on each side of the post.</p>

<p>The clown works best when cut out of wood. In this case the
body <span class="smcap">E</span> and post <span class="smcap">B</span> may be cut out in one piece, one leg and one
arm are then attached to the front of the body, and one leg and
one arm behind.</p>

<p>Fig. 459 shows a soldier on the march. He is made of three
pieces of wood. Head, body, arms and stand <span class="smcap">A</span> are cut out in one
piece, the legs are cut out separately and riveted loosely to the
body; only two pieces of wire are needed, one on each side, to
work the legs. The gun may be a piece of wire or wood fixed
on after-ward. The wheels are &frac12; inch in thickness.</p>

<p>Other similar toys worked by wheels can be made by cutting
a hole in the bottom of the cart. One axle of the cart must run
exactly under this hole, it must be made of wire and bent as <span class="smcap">B C</span>
in Fig. 460.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 459</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span><span class="smcap">D</span> and <span class="smcap">E</span> are pieces of tin nailed to the cart, through holes in
which axle <span class="smcap">B C</span> freely turns; or wooden blocks may be nailed on
for the axle to turn in, if tin cannot be obtained. The ends of the
axle are securely fastened into solid wooden wheels. As the
wheels revolve they will push up and down a piece of wire or
wooden rod, <span class="smcap">F</span>, which is fastened to the bent part of the axle.
Now <span class="smcap">F</span> can be
used to work
a number of
simple toys, if
its free end is
fastened to the
part which it
is desired to
move. For example
by this
means an animal's
mouth may be made to open and shut as it is wheeled
along, or its head to wag; a blacksmith may be made to strike
his anvil, the drummer to beat his drum. The ingenious child
will be able to adapt this simple piece of mechanism to many
a toy.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 461</span></div>
</div>

<p><b>A Lively Dog.</b> Cut out with a fret-saw two pieces of wood as
<span class="smcap">F</span> in Fig. 461, which represents the body and legs of a dog in one
piece. Now cut out the head <span class="smcap">H</span> (notice length of neck behind
body) and the tail <span class="smcap">K</span> from wood &frac14; inch thick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>Now glue the two bodies to a piece of stripwood <span class="smcap">A</span> (&frac12; inch by
&frac12; inch) placed along the tops of bodies inside (Fig. 462), and
bevelled so that the legs of the dog will be further apart than
the upper portion. The legs are joined by
pieces of stripwood, <span class="smcap">M</span>, &frac14; inch by &frac14; inch,
about 1&frac12; inches long. Notice that the ends
of these strips are bevelled. Now make
hole, <span class="smcap">E</span>, in the head-piece; notice that there
is the same length of wood above <span class="smcap">E</span> as below
it. Make corresponding holes <span class="smcap">E</span> in sides <span class="smcap">F</span>.
Pass a piece of wire through the hole in the
dog's head and see how it
hangs; the head portion
will be the heavier and
sink. Now take the head
off, saw out a piece of
wood at <span class="smcap">B</span>, insert a piece
of lead and try again. It
is an easy matter if too
much lead has been added
to cut off a little. When
the head is correctly
balanced, as in Fig. 461,
bend over the wire so that
it cannot come off. The
tail, <span class="smcap">K</span>, is attached in the
same way.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 464</span></div>
</div>

<p>Small wheels, <span class="smcap">N</span>, cut
from some convenient
round rod are then nailed to <span class="smcap">M</span>. The dog should be suitably
coloured. When drawn along he wags his tail and bends his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>The legs look rather better if cut out separately and glued
to the sides.</p>

<p><b>The Tumbling Clown or Monkey.</b> Cut out cardboard or
wooden animals similar to those in Part I, Chapter XX, but use
no lead. Now, instead of swinging them on a perch, make a hole
at <span class="smcap">B</span> where they stand; take a piece of copper wire, about 1/8 inch
thick and 6 inches long.</p>

<p>Bend it slightly as in Fig. 463. Pass the wire through the
hole in the animal, so that the animal fits tightly on it exactly
in the middle of wire.</p>

<p>The animals are best cut out of thick cardboard. Fig. 464
shows a suitable animal, and the following from Chapter XX&mdash;Figs.
256, 257, 259, 263 and 264&mdash;can be adapted. As no lead
can be used for the purpose to which we are now going to put
them, animals that balance without lead, as in Fig. 464, are the
most suitable. Therefore in designing them, one must take
care that the hole <span class="smcap">B</span> is exactly at the centre of gravity,
and the bend of body, <span class="smcap">D</span> (that is widest part of body), just
below <span class="smcap">B</span>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 465</span></div>
</div>

<p><b>To make the Monkey tumble.</b> Cut a piece of wood 12 inches
by 2&frac12; inches, and fix parallel bars to this as in Fig. 465. File or
cut notches in the ends at <span class="smcap">A</span>, to keep the monkey from tumbling
off in his zeal. Now put the wire with the monkey in the middle
across one end of the rails. Push the monkey head over heels
and he will go on solemnly turning over and over, however long
the rails are, until he lands in safety in the notches at the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
end. It is the bend in the wire and carefully balanced body of
the monkey that makes him behave so delightfully.</p>

<p>The longer the stand is the better, for then two or three clowns,
monkeys and cockatoos can follow each other rapidly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_280.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 466</span></div>
</div>

<p>The bars must be high enough to allow the monkey to turn
without touching the ground&mdash;4&frac12; inches high will just do if length
of monkey from <span class="smcap">B</span> to <span class="smcap">C</span> (Fig. 464) is 4&frac12; inches.</p>

<p>Fig. 466 shows two clowns swinging together; a variety of
funny figures can be made to follow each other along the bars.</p>

KITES, GLIDERS, AND AEROPLANES</h3>


<p><b>Kites.</b> Perhaps one of the easiest kites to make is one which
the children of Annam and Tonking delight to play with. To
make it, three light bamboo canes are required&mdash;about 2 feet in
length&mdash;those used for flower-sticks will do quite well. Tie them
strongly together as in Fig. 467.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 468</span></div>
</div>

<p>The backbone <span class="smcap">E F</span> should be quite rigid, but the cross-pieces
<span class="smcap">A B</span> and <span class="smcap">C D</span> are better if they are slightly curved. A sheet of
light paper must now be pasted from <span class="smcap">A B</span> to <span class="smcap">C D</span> underneath <span class="smcap">E F</span>
in such a way that it is quite tight under <span class="smcap">E F</span>, but rather loose
between <span class="smcap">A C</span> and <span class="smcap">B D</span>.</p>

<p>Fig. 468 shows how the paper should be cut. <span class="smcap">G H</span> is the exact
distance between <span class="smcap">E</span> and <span class="smcap">F</span>; <span class="smcap">J K</span> and <span class="smcap">L M</span> are wider than distances
between <span class="smcap">A C</span> and <span class="smcap">B D</span> in Fig. 467, so that when the flaps on the
paper are pasted over the cross-bits the paper is loose between
<span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">C</span> and between <span class="smcap">B</span> and <span class="smcap">D</span> (Fig. 467). The secret of the
balance is to have the flutter at the edges quite equal. Fig. 467
shows how the string is fastened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p><b>A Box Kite.</b> This is a very common form of kite and quite
easy to make. Take four laths from 27 to 30 inches in length
and four pieces about 13 inches in length. The smaller pieces
are fastened together with nails and glue, as in Fig. 470 (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>).
To the ends of these the long pieces are nailed and glued, as in
Fig. 470 (<i>b</i>). Mark off the long pieces into thirds and over the two
end thirds sew strips of light material. Tie on the string as shown
in Fig. 469. This kite is said to be an American invention.</p>

<p>A similar kite may be made triangular in form.</p>

<p>Fig. 471 shows another form of the box kite. Here the
material covers a little less than &frac14; of the strip <span class="smcap">A B</span>. Cross-bars
<span class="smcap">E F</span> and <span class="smcap">C D</span> are tied across the middle and to the four sides, and
wings are sewn on to them.</p>

<p>Figs. 472 and 473 are modifications of the triangular form of
kite. In both these kites the long strips of wood are from
2&frac12; to 3 feet in length.</p>

<p>Notice that in Fig. 472, <span class="smcap">A B</span> is the same length as <span class="smcap">D E</span>, <span class="smcap">F G</span> = <span class="smcap">D H</span>;
<span class="smcap">E H</span> = about &frac14; of <span class="smcap">E D</span>.</p>

<p>In Fig. 473 <span class="smcap">A B</span> = <span class="smcap">C D</span>. <span class="smcap">C E</span> = about &frac14; of <span class="smcap">C D</span>. <span class="smcap">F G</span> equal about
1/3 of <span class="smcap">A B</span>. <span class="smcap">F C</span> = <span class="smcap">C E</span>. <span class="smcap">A H</span> and
<span class="smcap">J K</span> are light frames of stripwood
covered with calico. The diagrams
show how these kites are
put together.</p>

<p><b>A Chinese Kite.</b> The kites
used in China are very light and
flimsy compared to our kites, as
they are made of tissue paper
and bamboo.</p>

<p>In making one it is better to
use somewhat stronger paper.
The paper is cut out as in Fig.
474, the two upper sides being
slightly shorter than the two lower. Leave two rectangular
pieces <span class="smcap">A</span>, <span class="smcap">A</span>, at each end of the shorter sides. A piece of split<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
bamboo, slightly flattened, is glued firmly to the paper from <span class="smcap">B</span> to <span class="smcap">C</span>.
A second piece of bamboo tapering at the ends is used as a cross-piece
<span class="smcap">D</span>. This is bent as in the figure so that where it crosses the
backbone, <span class="smcap">B C</span>, it is only a few inches from the apex, <span class="smcap">B</span>. It is tied
to <span class="smcap">B C</span> at <span class="smcap">D</span>. Its tapering ends are pasted down to the paper by
means of the two flaps, <span class="smcap">A</span>, <span class="smcap">A</span>. Bamboo <span class="smcap">B C</span> should not be more
than 1/3 inch in width, piece <span class="smcap">D</span>, &frac14; inch. To prevent the paper
getting torn in a good breeze, tie fine cotton round the border of
the kite&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> from <span class="smcap">B</span> to <span class="smcap">A</span>, to <span class="smcap">C</span>, to <span class="smcap">A</span>, and to <span class="smcap">B</span> again. Paste a thin
margin of paper over the cotton, enclosing it, and to the kite.
This must be done so that the face of the kite is perfectly flat;
it must not bag in any way.</p>

<p><b>To fly the Kite.</b> Much depends on the way in which the
'belly-band' is tied on. Its upper string is tied to <span class="smcap">D</span>, and the
lower to the backbone, <span class="smcap">B C</span>, almost anywhere below a line from
<span class="smcap">A</span> to <span class="smcap">A</span>. If the two strings are very near together, the kite behaves
in a more lively manner, darting about in all directions.</p>

<p>The kite must be coaxed into the air by a series of jerks and
pulls when the apex of the kite is facing upwards. It is inclined
to turn round at first and some patience is required to learn when
to pull and when to jerk. If one pulls at the wrong time it will
dart down and then unless sufficient string is quickly let out, it
will fall to the ground.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_284.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 475</span></div>
</div>

<p>When once the kite is up, it does not keep stationary like an
English kite, but is always darting
about; a skilful flyer can make a
kite dart down and almost touch
the roof of a house at a great
distance off, and then dart up
again almost overhead.</p>

<p>It is not an easy kite to manage,
but when once the art of flying it
is mastered it is never forgotten.</p>

<p><b>Gliders.</b> The earliest type of
toy flying-machine consisted of a
two-bladed tin propeller spun on
a frame by unwinding string, as
with a top, and suddenly let go. It is easily made, as shown in
Fig. 475, where <span class="smcap">A</span> is a tin propeller nailed by nails <span class="smcap">C</span> and <span class="smcap">C</span> to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
large reel <span class="smcap">B</span>. In making this toy the nails must be driven into the
reel first, their heads are then cut off and they are tightly fitted
into holes in propeller <span class="smcap">A</span>. <span class="smcap">D</span> is the axle on which the reel spins and
the handle for holding it; <span class="smcap">E</span> is a washer. This flying-machine is
worked by smartly pulling a length of string wound around the reel.</p>

<p>Modern aeroplanes are far more difficult to make than this;
they need patience, skill and experiment, and besides a knowledge
of how to twist and bend wood by steaming it; plenty
of cane and whalebone wire, tissue paper or fine Japanese silk,
and catapult elastic, which is generally the motive power used
in working model aeroplanes. (Messrs Gamage, Holborn, W.C.,
stock skeins of specially prepared elastic.)</p>

<p>In this chapter only the simple and well-known types will be
very briefly described, the boy who is interested must get special
books on this subject from his library. In the first place the
beginner must know what the three types of machines used in
designing models generally are&mdash;viz. (1) the glider or motorless
model, a glider being a winged structure, which when released
from a height does not fall directly to the ground, but descends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
gracefully at a gentle slope; (2) the monoplane, which is constructed
more or less on the lines of a bird; and (3) the biplane
or double-winged aeroplane.</p>

<p>Gliders may be either of the monoplane or biplane type.
Experiments with gliders will enable boys to find out some of the
principles on which aeroplanes are built, and will prepare them to
undertake the construction of more difficult forms.</p>

<p>In making one's first glider one cannot do better than copy
a bird. On a piece of paper draw a circle, fold it in half, draw a
bird on one half, as in Fig. 476, cut it out, when the paper is
opened it will appear as in the figure. If this bird is thrown head
first toward the ground, it will probably fall. If two little bits of
cardboard are gummed on each side of his head, he will make a
better flight and land on the ground after making a gentle curve.
A still better bird may be cut from cardboard, a half cut is then
made along <i>a b</i> to bend it, and the head is weighted with sealing-wax.
How well this bird flies depends on the weight, and to some
extent on the shape of the bird. Birds of various shapes and with
different amounts of sealing-wax should be tried, until one is
made that glides to the ground in a long, graceful curve.</p>

<p>In making bird gliders the following points should be
remembered:</p>

<p>(1) Draw the bird in a circle as already explained, this ensures
that the wings will be exactly balanced.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_286.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 477</span></div>
</div>

<p>(2) If the head in Fig. 476 is not long enough for a graceful
flight, a longer
head cut from
cardboard can be
pasted on.</p>

<p>(3) If the bird
dives quickly
down head first,
you know that
the head is too
heavy, or the neck
too long.</p>

<p>(4) If the bird
rises and then falls the head is too light and probably not long
enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>(5) The wings can be made larger if necessary by the addition
of tissue-paper wings gummed on as <span class="smcap">A</span> in Fig. 477.</p>

<p><b>Another Glider.</b> Cut out a piece of paper 8 inches by 4 inches,
<span class="smcap">A B C D</span> in Fig. 478. Mark <span class="smcap">B E</span> and <span class="smcap">D F</span> each 1 inch; make cuts
along the dark lines at <span class="smcap">E</span> and <span class="smcap">F</span> to the depth of 1 inch. Draw the
broken lines along the paper, dividing it into four equal strips.
Bend sides <span class="smcap">A E</span> and <span class="smcap">C F</span> downward along dotted lines. Bend <span class="smcap">E B</span>
and <span class="smcap">F D</span> upward along middle dotted lines, and press side <span class="smcap">C F</span>
toward side <span class="smcap">A E</span>, part way along this line, but leaving the part
near the ends <span class="smcap">A C</span> flat; to this end plane <span class="smcap">K</span> will be gummed
(Fig. 479). <span class="smcap">K</span> is 6 inches by 1 inch. Cut tail, <span class="smcap">G</span>, and gum on as in
diagrams. It can be weighted at <span class="smcap">H</span> by gumming several strips
of cardboard across or by affixing sealing-wax. Although this
is not a very graceful-looking glider it works most successfully,
and will describe quite a graceful curve toward the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>The child will find it interesting to make a number of these
gliders and then go one day to a window or high place and let them
glide to the ground and thus find out the bird that has the longest
flight. Or a number of children can have glider races and see
who can make a glider that alights on the ground farthest from
them. Other forms of gliders can be made, but they are all on
the same principle, a somewhat long body, wings and weight
adjusted to keep them from falling.</p>

<p>Fig. 480 shows a glider made from a dowel rod, with slits in
it at each end through which two cardboard planes are passed and
fastened. The cardboard must be of light weight and yet stiff
enough not to flap. The size of the planes must be found by
experiment, for their size will depend naturally upon the weight
of the material used. The bigger plane should be in length about
twice the smaller one. It is best to fasten the large plane on first
and then adjust the smaller one to give a long, graceful flight.</p>

<p>If a split pole can be found it is an easy matter to fasten the
planes in. Canes (bamboo) split readily and can be used as centre
pole.</p>

<p>This glider can fairly easily be made into an aeroplane and
worked with a propeller. It may be mentioned here that model
aeroplanes are generally worked with the propeller in front and
not in the rear.</p>

<p><b>To make Propellers.</b> These can be made of tin or wood.
A tin propeller can be cut from any old tin with a pair of shears
or strong scissors kept for the purpose. Cut two blades to the
shape shown in Fig. 481.</p>

<p>Next cut an oblong block of wood (Fig. 482); notice that
width <i>a b</i> in Fig. 482 must equal <i>a b</i> in Fig. 481, therefore width
of <i>a b</i> must be a little less than <i>a b</i> in Fig. 481. Slit each end
diagonally as in Fig. 482 for about &frac12; inch to hold the blades.
Drill a hole through centre of block for the wire axle <i>d c</i>. Insert
the blades in the slots, bend the ends over slightly and nail them
in the wood to keep them firm. Fix the wire shaft firmly in the
block as in Fig. 482. The propeller is now ready to be attached
to the glider.</p>

<p>Before this is done, however, we shall consider the making of
a wooden propeller. This is rather more difficult to make.
Cut a piece of wood to the shape shown in Fig. 483 with a sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
pen-knife. The propeller must then be given the correct twist
by means of the steaming kettle. Take hold of the extreme ends
of the propeller and hold it over the jet of steam so that steam
plays upon the blades at each side of the thick central portion.</p>

<p>When the wood is supple, twist it as in Fig. 484. This sounds
easier to do than it really is, the difficulty being to get the twist
on one side exactly equal to the twist on the other. For this
reason the tin propellers are more satisfactory to make. However
suppose the correct twist has been given, the next thing to do
is to sand-paper the wooden propeller carefully and file a groove
around the middle at <span class="smcap">A</span>; now wrap a piece of wire, <span class="smcap">A C</span>, tightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
around the propeller in this central groove, and put on the head,
<span class="smcap">B</span>. The propeller is now ready to be fastened to the glider shown
in Fig. 480.</p>

<p><b>To fasten Propeller to Glider.</b> Cut a piece of tin to the pattern
shown in Fig. 485, bend along the dotted line; make a hole at
<span class="smcap">F</span> for axle, <span class="smcap">B C</span>, to go through. Bend portion <span class="smcap">E</span> round the front end
of the glider, keep it in its place by bending it with thread coated
with glue; portion <span class="smcap">F</span> with the hole is bent down at right angles as
shown in Fig. 486. Now pass axle, <span class="smcap">A C</span>, through hole <span class="smcap">F</span>, bend end
<span class="smcap">C</span> into a hook. Put screw-eye <span class="smcap">D</span> in the rod about one-third of
length of rod from the other end (see Fig. 486). Fasten strands
of elastic from hook <span class="smcap">C</span> to <span class="smcap">D</span>. It is best really to have a hook at
<span class="smcap">D</span> so that the elastic can be slipped over. The strands should be
just loose enough to remain taut when unwound. When the
propeller is in position the planes will probably have to be readjusted.
The tin propeller can be attached in a similar way.
These propellers will do for almost any simple design of aeroplanes.</p>

<p>When the motor is wound up for flight, the number of turns
to give to the propeller will depend upon the strength and number
of the elastic strands used. About a hundred turns is a usual
number. Throw the motor forward in a slightly downward direction;
because it is a glider it will tend to follow a gentle curve
to the ground at first, but the whirling propeller will tend to carry
it forward and upward. The first attempts may be failures, but
these models are well worth many trials.</p>

<p><b>The Hawk Aeroplane</b> (Fig. 487) is a common flying toy
worked as the above by elastic. Cut two blocks of wood, <span class="smcap">A</span>, <span class="smcap">A&acute;</span>;
make holes in them as shown. Into the square holes fix and glue
two square rods <span class="smcap">C</span>. Through <span class="smcap">A&acute;</span> bore a hole for the piece of cane,
<span class="smcap">B B&acute;</span>, to pass through. <span class="smcap">F</span> is a wire spindle with a hook at one end
for elastic; it passes through the hole in block <span class="smcap">A&acute;</span>, through two
beads, and through a piece of cork, <span class="smcap">F</span>, into which it must be fixed.
<span class="smcap">K</span> is a piece of cane bent as in diagram, passing through a hole in
cork, <span class="smcap">H</span>. The bend is more <i>permanent</i> if the cane is held to the
spout of a boiling kettle; the ends of <span class="smcap">K</span> should be slightly warped
in opposite directions. Into block <span class="smcap">A</span> another wire hook is fixed
and bands of elastic are passed over this hook and the opposite
one, as in the diagram; the more bands the better.</p>

<p>The cane <span class="smcap">B B&acute;</span> is bent round at each end and fastened to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
wooden rods, <span class="smcap">C C</span>, by thread. The cane, <span class="smcap">K K</span>, is fastened by thread
as in the diagram; the thread can pass through a hole in the cork.
Spaces <span class="smcap">T</span>, <span class="smcap">T</span>, <span class="smcap">T</span>, <span class="smcap">T</span> are covered with thin tissue paper gummed to
thread and cane by means of overlapping edges. The model is
wound up and set going like the previous one. Care must be
taken to have it properly balanced, and it must be made as light
as possible; the blocks <span class="smcap">A</span>, <span class="smcap">A&acute;</span> may very well be cut from cork.
Light bamboo cane can be used for posts, <span class="smcap">C C</span>. At its best, however,
the Hawk Aeroplane is not so good a flyer as the first
model described.</p>

<p>An ambitious and clever boy who has once grasped the
principles on which flying-machines are made can think out many
models for himself and copy some of the more elaborate ones.
The biplane makes a very effective toy, but is omitted here
because it is somewhat difficult to construct.</p>

MORE OLD-FASHIONED TOYS</h3>


<p><b>Jacob's Ladder.</b> This is a very old and ingenious puzzle and
an amusing toy. It is very simply made. A number of blocks
of wood must be made, 4" &times; 2&frac12;" &times; 3/8". Any number may be used,
but not less than seven; twelve is a very good number.</p>

<p>Round the edges of the blocks and make them smooth with
sand-paper, as in Fig. 488. Cut strips of tape about &frac14; inch wide
and long enough to go over the rounded ends of the blocks,
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, etc., in Fig. 488. There are three tapes to each block.
Nail and glue tape <i>a</i> to the centre of upper end of block <span class="smcap">A</span>; it is
then brought over and downward under the middle of the lower
end of block <span class="smcap">B</span> and fastened.</p>

<p>Tapes <i>b b</i> are now fastened to the opposite end of <span class="smcap">A</span> about
&frac14; inch from the end on either side, and are then brought round the
opposite end of <span class="smcap">B</span>, as shown in the diagram. The centre tape <i>c</i>
is fastened to <span class="smcap">B</span> and then brought down underneath to centre of
the opposite end of <span class="smcap">C</span>. The tapes must be arranged like this
throughout the whole set of blocks.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 490</span></div>

<p>Fig. 489 shows how the blocks are held when they are all
complete. Top block <span class="smcap">A</span> must be
turned so as to bring the second
block to the same level. The top
of this block then falls, and it
appears to pass rapidly down
first on one side and then on the
other, until it reaches the bottom.
This is only what <i>seems</i> to
happen. What really happens
is that the second block becomes
reversed and falls back again, in
its former position. This makes
it come level with the third block,
which at once falls over on the
fourth, and so on to the end of the
ladder. A very illusive effect is
thus produced. The blocks might
be coloured with some bright
enamel paint, contrasting colours
on opposite sides.</p>

<p><b>The Trellis Toy</b> (Fig. 490).
The strips of wood for this toy
should be as thin as possible.
They are fastened together at
points 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., by small pieces of wire, or by rivets bent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
down to prevent their slipping off, but not too tightly, so that
the toy works easily. Heads can be cut out of cardboard painted
and glued to the wood. Strips <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span> should be wider at one
end and have holes made in them for handles.</p>

<p><b>A Running Mouse.</b> This toy is made of fret-wood, two
ordinary reels and elastic.</p>

<p>Choose two reels of about 1&frac12; inches in length, diameter about
1 inch.</p>

<p>Cut out a piece of wood, <span class="smcap">A</span>, to measurements given (Fig. 491).
With a fret-saw cut out the head (Fig. 492); slit <span class="smcap">B</span> is a little wider
than the thickness of the wood, so that the head wags about very
easily when wired to the body (Fig. 494). Cut out four legs as in
Fig. 493. The reels work behind these so that the shape of the
leg partly hides them. Nail the back legs to the body as shown
in Fig. 494. Make a round axle to fit one of the reels so that it
turns easily on it; cut it the exact length of the distance between
the two back legs, pass it through the reel and glue its ends, <span class="smcap">C</span>,
to the legs so that the reel comes slightly below the legs and can
run along easily. Now make holes, <span class="smcap">D</span>, in the front legs, and nail
them to the body so that holes <span class="smcap">D</span> are on a level with the axle <span class="smcap">C</span>.
Make a hole through the body <span class="smcap">A</span>, midway between the front legs,
through which the string, <span class="smcap">E</span>, will pass. Make holes in the other
reel and insert wire staples at each end as in Fig. 495. Fasten to
and wind round the reel about a yard of string. Pass rubber
bands through each staple (<span class="smcap">F</span> in Fig. 495) and through the holes
<span class="smcap">D</span> in the front legs and knot on the outside. Pass the string
through the hole in <span class="smcap">A</span> (Fig. 496).</p>

<p><b>To fasten Head on.</b> Make two holes in the head exactly over
each other, <span class="smcap">G</span> and <span class="smcap">H</span> in Fig. 492. Slip the head on to the body and
make a hole through the body, between holes <span class="smcap">G</span> and <span class="smcap">H</span>, as shown in
Fig. 497. Bend a piece of wire as in Fig. 498, distance between bent
ends being equal to distance between holes <span class="smcap">G</span> and <span class="smcap">H</span>; slip the wire
through the hole in the body, pass the ends of the wire through
holes <span class="smcap">G</span> and <span class="smcap">H</span>, then bend the ends over to the position shown by the
dotted lines in Fig. 498; the mouse's head will then swing from
side to side. Make a hole in end at <span class="smcap">L</span> (Fig. 494) and insert a tail of
thick string. A piece of wood, <span class="smcap">M</span>, shaped as in Fig. 494, may be
glued along part of the body, <span class="smcap">A</span>, a little to one side so as not to
interfere with string, <span class="smcap">E</span>. The whole may be suitably coloured.</p>

<p>The toy works in this way. If it is placed on the floor
and the string held, the weight of the toy will make the
twine unwind, thus causing the elastic which supports the
reel to twist. When the string is slackened, the elastic will
untwist again, making the reel revolve and the toy run along
the ground.</p>

same way; the antenn&aelig; may be made of wire. Other suitable
animals are a lizard and a crocodile.</p>

<p><b>A Hygroscope.</b> The cottage is made of thin wood about

as shown in Fig. 502. Drill a hole in the floor of the cottage,
about an inch from the middle of the partition. The wire axle
should fit into this so that it turns easily, but not too loosely,
otherwise the disc on which the figures stand will wobble. Just
over this hole there must be another hole in the roof. This can
be made by filing, with round fret-saw file, a little hollow
(Fig. 503) in each of the top sides of the roof, so that when
they come together a hole is formed. The back, sides, floor
and roof may now be nailed and glued together. Next cut
out from three-ply wood with the fret-saw two little figures
as in Fig. 501; they should be about 2 inches to 2&frac14; inches,
and should be suitably coloured. These are glued to the
wooden disc.</p>

<p>The disc is hung from the roof by a piece of catgut; a knot
is made at the end to prevent it slipping through, the other end
being tied to the wire loop; the wire passes through the hole in
the floor. The catgut must be long enough to allow the disc to
turn round completely on its axis. Four pieces of wood or four
small reels are glued to the corners of the floor to prevent the wire
axle from touching the ground. The front must not be put on
until the model is found to work correctly. To do this, hang the
disc so that it is parallel to the ground, and so that both figures
are looking out of their respective doors; then tie the knot at the
top and wait for a change of weather.</p>

<p>Supposing on a damp day the cricketer comes forward and the
boy in mackintosh and sou'wester retires indoors, this is because
the catgut is twisting the wrong way, therefore the end that is
fastened to the roof must be fastened to the wire loop, and vice
versa. Now the front can be glued on. It can be suitably painted,
showing door-posts, windows, bricks, etc.</p>

<p><b>Why the Hygroscope works.</b> Catgut has the peculiar property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
of absorbing moisture from the air and twisting up and becoming
shorter; when the air is dry it untwists to its original length;
the damper the air the greater is the amount of the twist. Hence
in the model, as the catgut twists and untwists according to the
state of the atmosphere, the little figures swing in and out of the
cottage doors.</p>

</div>

<p><b>A Lift.</b> There are a variety of ways of making a lift. One of
the simplest is shown in this chapter. The first essential is a
wooden box, oblong if possible, so that there can be many floors.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
The measurements given in this chapter are for quite a small model
made from a shallow oblong box, 9&frac12; inches by 14&frac34; inches, and
about 2&frac12; inches in depth.</p>

<p>Sand-paper the inside and cover it with some pretty paper.
Mark off distances <span class="smcap">A C</span> and <span class="smcap">B D</span> (Fig. 504) equal to 2&frac12; inches; rule
lines <span class="smcap">A B</span> and <span class="smcap">C D</span> along the bottom of the box; glue pieces of stripwood
&frac14; inch by &frac12; inch (<span class="smcap">A B</span> and <span class="smcap">C D</span> in Fig. 504) along the bottom
of the box for the lift to run up and down between.</p>

<p>The lift is made next. Cut two pieces of wood 2&frac12; inches
by 2&frac14; inches; nail to the corners of one piece four pieces of
stripwood, &frac14;" &times; &frac14;" &times; 3". Fasten the other piece of wood to these
four posts by means of screw-eyes. Now leave the lift for a
while.</p>

<p>Cut two pieces of cardboard, <span class="smcap">A B E F</span> and <span class="smcap">C D H G</span>, to divide
the box into three long divisions, as in Fig. 504. See that they
project &frac14; inch beyond the box. Divide these strips into three
parts and draw and cut out doors as in the diagram; the line for
the floors must, of course, be well above the top of the lift, while
the height of the doors must correspond to that of the lift. Now
glue these strips of cardboard to the pieces of stripwood <span class="smcap">A B</span> and
<span class="smcap">C D</span> as in diagram; see that the doors open into the rooms on each
side, and not into the lift.</p>

<p>See that the lift runs easily up and down between the cardboard
strips; sand-paper it if it does not.</p>

<p>Make four holes in the top of the box, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i> in Fig. 505.
Tie thread or black yarn to the screw-eyes, cross it and pass it
through the holes as in the figure, then pass the four cables through
screw-eye <span class="smcap">K</span>. When the lift is on the ground, pull the strings taut
and tie a knot below the screw-eye. The lift can be raised by
means of winding gear attached to the side as described in
Chapter V, on the crane; the weight of the lift will pull it down
again, or if this is not enough it can be weighted with lead.</p>

<p>Fig. 505 shows another way of working the model. Screw-eyes
can be fastened to the bottom of the lift and thread tied to them
as before; these threads must pass through four holes in the
bottom of the box, through a hole in the support <span class="smcap">L M</span> and through
screw-eye <span class="smcap">Q</span>; the bottom strings are then knotted to the top strings
at <span class="smcap">R</span>, and the lift can be lowered and raised by moving knot <span class="smcap">R</span>
up and down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>The supports <span class="smcap">N P</span> and <span class="smcap">L M</span> are made of pieces of stripwood
&frac12; inch by &frac14; inch.</p>

<img src="images/i_301_506.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 506</span></div>
</div>

<p>Cut a door out of cardboard as shown in Fig. 506 and glue it
over the front of the lift. (In Fig. 506 the dotted lines are half
cuts, the black lines are cut.)</p>

<p>Nail strips of wood &frac14; inch by &frac14; inch, <span class="smcap">E F</span> and <span class="smcap">H G</span>, in front of
the lift and glue the pieces of cardboard to them. They keep the
lift from falling forward. If the lift is moved up and down, as
shown in Fig. 505, it is best for it to fit fairly tightly so that it
stays into whatever position it is pulled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>Cardboard floors, 1, 2, 3, 4 (Fig. 504), are added, and kept in
position by pieces of stripwood.</p>

<p>The rooms on each side can be furnished according to taste
and according to their size. The lift itself may be finished off
with advertisements, directions to travellers, etc., according
as it is intended for use in a railway station, a hotel, a store,
etc.</p>

<p>This toy, although so simply made, is very effective.</p>

<p><b>Pont Roulant at Saint-Malo.</b> This is a pretty model to make.
First glue four pieces of stripwood, 3/8" &times; 1/8" &times; 4&frac12;", together (<span class="smcap">A A A A</span>
in Fig. 507). Nail and glue to the corners of this framework four
round rods, 10&frac14; inches long and &frac14; inch in diameter. Dowel rods
such as these are somewhat difficult to nail on; however, should
the wood of the little frame split, or the hole in the dowel rod be
made too large for the nail, and so make the structure unsteady,
the discs of cork (<span class="smcap">C</span> in Fig. 507), which have a hole filed in the middle
of them and are glued to the rods and the framework, help to consolidate
the whole. Similar discs of cork are placed round the
middle of rods, <span class="smcap">B</span>, and at the tops of the rods. These serve to hold
the black yarn which rigs the structure. The pieces of cork at
the top have the additional advantage of making a steadier base
for the platform to rest on. If the poles are not all cut exactly
the same length, the discs of cork can be raised above the shorter
poles and the platform on top made perfectly horizontal. These
cork discs also give a larger surface to glue the platform to.
Instead of dowel rods, iron wire 1/8 inch in diameter can be used.
These wire rods must have cork discs on them like the wooden
rods, but they must be glued into holes in the lower framework
and in the platform.</p>

<p>Having fixed the rods in position, thread is tied underneath
a bottom piece of cork (<span class="smcap">C<sup>5</sup></span> in diagram), passed over the top of rod
<span class="smcap">B<sup>3</sup></span> and kept there by the cork disc at the top, round the bottom
of post <span class="smcap">B<sup>4</sup></span> and under the bottom cork, over the next post and so on,
so that the threads cross each other as in the diagram. Thread is
also tied round the middle of the rods just above corks <span class="smcap">C<sup>1</sup></span>, <span class="smcap">C<sup>2</sup></span>, <span class="smcap">C<sup>3</sup></span>,
and <span class="smcap">C<sup>4</sup></span>. Thread is also tied from <span class="smcap">C<sup>2</sup></span> to <span class="smcap">C<sup>3</sup></span>, and <span class="smcap">C<sup>1</sup></span> to <span class="smcap">C<sup>4</sup></span>.</p>

<p>Pieces of stripwood, 3/8" &times; 1/8" &times; 4&frac12;", are glued across the frame
<span class="smcap">A A A A</span>. Next the platform has to be made; this is a piece of
wood 8&frac12; inches square and 1/8 inch in thickness. Before gluing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
it on to the four posts it is best to make and fasten to it the cabin,
railings, etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>The cabin, <span class="smcap">E</span>, in the middle is 3 inches square and 2 inches high;
it is cut out of cardboard. Flanges must be left for gluing it
to platform, and for gluing the roof to it. Doors and windows
are drawn round it or cut out. The cabin is then glued in the
middle of platform <span class="smcap">D</span>.</p>

<p>The roof is a piece of cardboard 3&frac14; inches by 8&frac12; inches. Fig.
508 shows how it is cut out, half cuts are made along the dotted
lines, and <span class="smcap">G</span>, <span class="smcap">K</span>, <span class="smcap">H</span>, <span class="smcap">M</span> are bent up to form the ornaments <span class="smcap">G</span>, <span class="smcap">K</span>, <span class="smcap">H</span>, <span class="smcap">M</span>
in Fig. 507.</p>

<p>The roof is glued to the top of cabin, <span class="smcap">E</span>, and to the tops of posts,
<span class="smcap">N</span>, which are pieces of stripwood &frac14;" &times; &frac14;" &times; 2".</p>

<p>Triangular pieces of cardboard are glued in the corners, as <span class="smcap">P</span>
in Fig. 507.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_304.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 509</span></div>
</div>

<p>The railings are 1 inch high; they can either be made of strips
of cardboard 1 inch by 8&frac12; inches supported at the corners and in
the middle by pieces of
stripwood &frac14;" &times; &frac14;" &times; 1",
with criss-cross lines
drawn on them, or be
made as in Fig. 509,
where <span class="smcap">A B</span> and <span class="smcap">C D</span> are
strips of cardboard &frac14;
inch wide, <span class="smcap">F</span> is stripwood &frac14; inch by &frac14; inch, and 1, 2, 3, etc., are
parts of match sticks glued to the cardboard strips. Seats can
be placed round the railings, and round the cabin where there
are no doors.</p>

<p>A piece of stripwood, <span class="smcap">R</span>, &frac12;" &times; &frac12;" &times; 1&frac12;", is cut and filed as in
Fig. 507 and glued to the middle of the roof.</p>

<p>The platform is then glued to the tops of the posts with their
surrounding corks. The frame, <span class="smcap">A A A A</span>, is mounted on wheels
1-1/8 inches in diameter and &frac14; inch in width. The axles are pieces
of stripwood &frac14; inch by &frac14; inch, to which the frame <span class="smcap">A A</span> is glued.</p>

<p>The rails on which it runs (<i>a b</i> in Fig. 507) are made in a similar
manner to those described in Chapter XIII, for the transporter
bridge. It is pulled along by thread tied to screw-eyes <span class="smcap">X</span> and <span class="smcap">Y</span>,
and wound up by winding gear similar to that described in
Chapter XIII.</p>

<p>Fig. 510 shows how high tide can be represented by means of
boxes and cardboard; <span class="smcap">D</span>, <span class="smcap">E</span>, <span class="smcap">F</span> are boxes which form a quay into
which the car runs. <span class="smcap">A</span>, <span class="smcap">B</span>, <span class="smcap">C</span> are pieces of cardboard resting on
pieces of stripwood glued to boxes <span class="smcap">D</span>, <span class="smcap">E</span>, <span class="smcap">F</span>, and similar boxes on
the other side, or the cardboard can rest on boxes. If boxes cannot
be found big enough for <span class="smcap">D</span>, <span class="smcap">E</span> and <span class="smcap">F</span>, several boxes can be built
up. Slots <i>a b</i> and <i>c d</i> must be left wide enough for the supports
to pass freely, and the threads must be omitted at front and
back. The rails must lie exactly under slots <i>a b</i> and <i>c d</i>. The
pieces of cardboard <span class="smcap">A</span>, <span class="smcap">B</span> and <span class="smcap">C</span> should be coloured blue. The
thread from the car underneath the "water" can pass into
box <span class="smcap">F</span> and up through a hole in the top, where the winding gear
can be placed, but, of course, it can be worked from below. Sheets
of cardboard <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">C</span> can be surrounded by boxes or fastened in a
large box, or have cardboard walls built around it.</p>

<p><b>Tower Bridge.</b> A very simple and effective model of Tower
Bridge can be made, which will prove a delightful plaything.</p>

<p>The measurements given in this chapter need not be followed,
but the bridge can be made larger or smaller according to
taste. The whole structure can be of wood or of wood and
cardboard.</p>

<p>Two small boxes are required, made of wood &frac14; inch thick, about
4 inches in length, breadth and height. (If such small boxes
cannot be found they must be made.)</p>

<p>Take off one side of box, <span class="smcap">A B C D</span> in Fig. 511, which shows the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
mechanism of the toy. Into the edges <span class="smcap">D F</span> and <span class="smcap">C E</span> screw two small
screw-eyes, <span class="smcap">G</span> and <span class="smcap">H</span>, about &frac14; inch from the top.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_306.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 511</span></div>
</div>

<p>Now cut a piece of wood 8&frac14; inches long for the bridge. The
width of bridge <i>a b</i> must be equal to width of interior of box. For
the present model it will be 3&frac12; inches.</p>

<p>The wood used for the bridge should be about 1/8 inch
thick.</p>

<p>Now rule a line 5&frac34; inches from end <i>a b</i>. On this line screw in
two small screw-eyes, <span class="smcap">K</span> and <span class="smcap">L</span>, of the same size as screw-eyes <span class="smcap">G</span>
and <span class="smcap">H</span>. The axle, <span class="smcap">M N</span>, may be either iron wire (in which case the
bridge may work rather loosely) or, what is better, a wooden rod
that just fits the screw-eyes. Whichever axle is chosen cork discs
should be placed at each end to prevent it slipping out. Before the
bridge is fastened on, screw-eyes <span class="smcap">O</span> and <span class="smcap">P</span> are screwed in it near the
end <i>c d</i>. Screw-eye <span class="smcap">P</span> must be far enough from the edge <i>b d</i> to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
clear screw-eye <span class="smcap">R</span> when the bridge is upright. The same with
screw-eye <span class="smcap">O</span>.</p>

<p>A piece of strong thread is tied to screw-eye <span class="smcap">P</span>, passed through
screw-eye <span class="smcap">R</span>, and through a hole in the drawbridge above screw-eye
<span class="smcap">R</span>, but clear of axle, <span class="smcap">M N</span>. A similar piece of thread is tied to
screw-eye <span class="smcap">O</span>, passed through <span class="smcap">Q</span>, and through a hole in the bridge.</p>

<p>Now cover up top, <span class="smcap">A B C D</span>, with a piece of cardboard, but do
not bring this quite up to <span class="smcap">B C</span>, in order not to interfere with the
working of the bridge. Make holes in the cardboard for the
strings to pass through. Then cover up the front portion, <span class="smcap">D C F E</span>,
below the bridge with cardboard.</p>

<p>The tower (Fig. 512) must next be made. This is formed of
one piece of cardboard: height, <i>a b</i>, 9 inches; width, <i>c d</i>, 3&frac14; inches.</p>

<p>In the sides facing the bridge large openings, <span class="smcap">E</span>, are cut about
2&frac12; inches high.</p>

<p>Small openings, <span class="smcap">F</span> and <span class="smcap">G</span>, about 1&frac12; inches high and &frac34; inch broad,
are cut for the overhead foot bridges. These are made of long
pieces of cardboard 2 inches broad, bent in three divisions to form
the path and sides. The latter are marked to represent railings.
They should be long enough to pass well inside the tower through
openings <span class="smcap">F</span> and <span class="smcap">G</span>, and through the corresponding openings in the
opposite tower. They can be glued into position by pieces of
stripwood or left movable.</p>

<p>A door, <span class="smcap">A</span>, should be made in the top of the tower and a platform
put in to make a compartment for working the bridge. The
pieces of thread are brought up through holes in this platform and
fastened to rod <span class="smcap">B</span>, which passes through holes in sides of tower,
and is kept from slipping out by cork discs. When this rod is
turned the bridge will rise or fall.</p>

<p>If a large model is being made a proper little windlass with a
handle can be constructed inside the upper room of the tower.
The threads pass up on each side of the tower so as not to interfere
with the "traffic" passing under the arch of the bridge. The
tower is fastened up with flanges and glued to the wooden box
with the help of small blocks of wood. A square pyramid is
placed on the top of the tower, and the whole is suitably coloured.
A picture of the real Tower Bridge is a great help when finishing
off the model.</p>

<p>A similar bridge and tower are made for the other side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_308.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 512</span></div>
</div>

<p>To keep the wooden boxes the right distance apart (that is, so
that bridge <span class="smcap">X</span> just touches bridge <span class="smcap">Y</span>) nail or glue them to a long
strip of wood painted blue. There is, however, no need to fasten
them permanently.</p>

<p>The ingenious toy-maker will find a hundred ways of improving
this toy. There are many additions that can be made if a picture
of the Tower Bridge is consulted; cardboard paths can lead to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
bridge <span class="smcap">X</span>, round the outside of the tower; railings can be added to
bridges <span class="smcap">X</span> and <span class="smcap">Y</span> (but see that they are not in the way when the
bridge goes up!), and so on. The method of raising and lowering
the bridges is capable of a number of modifications. It should be
the pleasant business of the maker to improve this model, and not
be content with too slavishly following the directions given.</p>

<p>Bridges are among the most interesting things in the world,
and there are countless happy hours in front of the little toy-maker
who sets to work to collect pictures and written accounts
of bridges, and who tries to imitate these.</p>

SOLDERING. SCREW STEAMER. TOYS WORKED
BY WIND AND BY CONVECTION CURRENTS</h3>


<p><b>Soldering.</b> A knowledge of soldering makes many more toys
possible, besides being a useful acquirement in itself. The
following are the materials needed:</p>

<p>1. A soldering iron (Fig. 513). This can be bought for sixpence
at any ironmonger's. It is best to get one not too long in the stem,
as otherwise it is difficult to hold it steady.</p>

<p>2. A strip of soft solder, price about three-halfpence.</p>

<p>3. Soldering fluid or flux. This can be made at home from a
pennyworth of spirits of salt (from an oil shop). Put a little of the
spirits into a separate bottle and drop a few scraps of zinc into it.
When it has stopped "fizzing" it is ready for use.</p>

<p>4. A pennyworth of resin.</p>

<p>5. A piece of sheet tin.</p>

<p>Soldering is not nearly so difficult as people think. There
is one thing really essential for its success, and that is unlimited
patience in cleaning the metal surfaces to be joined together.
Solder will not adhere to dirty metal. The surfaces must be
thoroughly scraped and cleaned with an old knife, then filed,
rubbed with emery-cloth and protected by a coating of flux.
The flux required for use should be kept in a shallow dish (<i>e.g.</i> a
meat-paste jar), to prevent it being upset; it can be put on with
a small brush.</p>

<p>The copper bit of the soldering iron must be covered with a
thin film of solder before any soldering is done; this is to ensure
that it is perfectly free from dirt or dust. This process is called
"tinning the bit." It is quite simple. Heat the iron to a dull red
heat, not quite red hot, as the solder would otherwise be destroyed.
Then quickly file the four faces of the point to remove any dirt or
oxide that may have got on it and which would prevent the solder
from sticking to the bit. Next dip the bit for a second or two in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
the soldering fluid and melt off a drop of solder on to the piece of
sheet tin on which is put a little piece of resin. Turn the point
of the bit round and round in the melted solder until it is completely
coated. It is very important that the soldering iron should
at no time be overheated, as this tinning would be burnt off; nor
can it be repeated too often that the surfaces to be joined must be
thoroughly cleaned; failure to do this is in most cases the cause
of unsuccessful soldering.</p>

<p>To solder handle <span class="smcap">A</span> to <span class="smcap">B</span> (Fig. 514). Thoroughly clean that part
of <span class="smcap">B</span> to which <span class="smcap">A</span> is to be fastened,
and handle <span class="smcap">A</span>, rubbing the edges
of <span class="smcap">A</span> with emery-cloth. Place
<span class="smcap">A</span> on <span class="smcap">B</span> and rub a little flux
with a brush along the join.
Dip the bit into the flux and
drop a spot or two of solder
on the edges by applying the
heated iron to the end of the
strip of solder. Apply the bit
to the solder and trail the
solder with the point of the hot iron round the join so
that it is filled up.</p>

<p>A little practice will soon enable this to be done successfully,
and the skill thus acquired makes the following toy possible.</p>

<p><b>A Steamer with a Screw Propeller.</b> Fig. 515 shows the
size and shape of the steamer. It should be about 4 inches wide
amidships, 3&frac12; inches deep, and hollowed out as thin as possible,
according to directions given in Chapter XIV. Fig. 516 shows the
measurements for the stern. The bows should be sharp.</p>

<p>This boat must be fairly large to take the tube which runs
through it. Fasten a strip of lead 1/8 inch thick to the bottom of
the keel. Paint the boat a suitable colour. When it is dry place
it in the water and mark on the stern-post, <span class="smcap">A B</span> (Fig. 516), the
height to which the water comes, for the propeller must come just
below this. Midway between this point and the end of the keel
bore a hole, <span class="smcap">C</span>, in the stern-post, through the boat in the direction
of the top of the bow. This hole should be 3/8 inch wide and can be
made with a red-hot wire.</p>

<p>A brass tube must now be bought from a gasfitter's, 3/8 inch</p>

outside measurement, and long enough to reach from <span class="smcap">C</span> to about
3&frac12; inches beyond the end of the bow. Now cut a piece of tin
&frac34; inch wide and 2 inches long. Bend the middle of it round the
tube and the ends outward (Fig. 517). Punch holes in each end.
Solder this strip round the tube about 4&frac12; inches from one end.
At this end file four teeth, about 1/8 inch deep, as in Fig. 518. Now
push the end that is not filed through the hole in the stern from
the inside of the boat, so that it is flush with the wood, and fasten
the other end to the stem of the boat by driving small nails through
the holes in the strip of tin into the boat. To prevent water
entering the boat put some putty round the tube where it passes
through the wood. Before fastening the tube in the boat, round
out the end of the bow slightly so that the tube will rest securely
on it without projecting too much above the gunwale. Make the
deck and fix it as described in Chapter XIV. Bore a hole, <span class="smcap">D</span>, in
Fig. 516, near the stern right through the deck so that it comes
out under the counter about 1 inch from the stern-post. It
should be large enough for a piece of stout wire to pass through.
This is for the rudder.</p>

<p><b>To make the Rudder.</b> Cut a piece of brass wire about 1/16 inch
thick, 6&frac14; inches long. Cut the rudder out of tin and shape as in
Fig. 519. Solder it on to the wire so that the end of the rudder is
flush with the end of the wire. Pass the wire through the hole, <span class="smcap">D</span>,
and bend as in Fig. 519. Cut a strip of tin about 1/3 inch in width,
punch holes in it, point the ends, bend them over and fasten them
into the deck so that the strip is under the bend, <span class="smcap">E</span>, of the tiller.
Press the tiller over and into one of these holes; thus the rudder
can be held firm in its required position for steering.</p>

<p>In the middle of the deck cut a hole about &frac34; inch in diameter
for the funnel, which is a tube of tin about 4 inches long.</p>

<p><b>The Propeller.</b> Cut a circle of tin 2 inches in diameter and
inscribe a hexagon; cut as in Fig. 520, the shaded portions being
cut away.</p>

<p>Punch a hole in the centre and into this fix, by soldering, a piece
of brass wire (1/16 inch thick), 2 inches long, to form an axle. Warp
the fans of the propeller out of the plane of the circle about &frac14; inch.
Make two pieces of wood shaped as in Fig. 521. Bore a hole
through each and by filing with a small round fret-saw file enlarge
it to 1/16 inch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>Put a glass bead, <span class="smcap">F</span> (Fig. 522), on wire of propeller, and put the
wire through one of the pieces of wood, bend the end into a small
hook. Take another piece of wire, pass it through the second piece
of wood and bend it as in Fig. 523. Now take a piece of strong
elastic, &frac14; inch wide and about 3&frac12; feet long; tie the ends together.
This must be passed through the tube in the boat. To do this,
tie a piece of string to the elastic, and drop the string through the
tube from the stern end, and by means of the string pull the elastic
through, first hooking one end of it to the hook on the propeller
wire, Fig. 522. Then push the piece of wood, <span class="smcap">G</span>, into the tube, so
that the screw clears the rudder. Now hook wire, <span class="smcap">H</span> (Fig. 523),
into the elastic, and push wood, <span class="smcap">K</span>, into tube. The wood must be
cut away so that the handle, <span class="smcap">M</span>, can catch in the teeth of the tube.</p>

<p>To make the boat work, hold the propeller steady with one
hand and wind up the elastic by the handle, <span class="smcap">M</span>; put the handle
in one of the teeth to keep the elastic twisted; set the rudder, put
the boat into the water, let go the propeller and the boat will go
on until the elastic is unwound. Instead of one band of elastic,
several thinner bands may be used, and more motive power can
thus be obtained.</p>

<p><b>Toys worked by the Wind.</b> Cut out of fret-wood (1/8 inch
thick), or three-ply wood, a man reading a paper with one foot
raised and resting on a box.</p>

<p>The man should be about 5&frac34; inches and his raised foot 1 inch
from the ground, as in Fig. 524. The shoeblack is cut out in three
pieces. First the kneeling portion, <span class="smcap">A</span> (Fig. 525), is cut 2 inches high
and a hole made at <i>b</i>; then the head with part of the arm to the
elbow attached, as <span class="smcap">H</span> in Fig. 526, about 1&frac34; inches high, and with
holes at <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>; then the hand (with long shoe-brush) and arm
to elbow, as <span class="smcap">K</span> in Fig. 527; make a hole at <i>f</i>. Length of <span class="smcap">K</span>
2&frac14; inches.</p>

<p>Now join <span class="smcap">K</span> to <span class="smcap">H</span> by wire or a rivet through holes <i>f</i> and <i>e</i>, so that
it swings loosely, then join <span class="smcap">H</span> to <span class="smcap">A</span> by a wire through holes <i>d</i> and <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>Colour these two figures suitably.</p>

<p>The base on which the figures rest is a piece of wood about
12 inches by 3 inches. The next thing to be made is the mechanism
that works the figures. First cut a piece of stripwood
&frac14;" &times; &frac14;" &times; 7", <span class="smcap">A</span> in Fig. 524. The fan or propeller, <span class="smcap">B</span>, is made by
cutting a small circular piece of wood or cork about 1 inch in
diameter and securely fixing round it five wind flaps as shown.
These flaps are best made of tin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>Now get a piece of stout copper wire (about 1/16 inch thick),
<span class="smcap">D</span> in Fig. 524, and bend it as in diagram. The best way to effect
this bend is first to make a sort of elongated [**Symbol: U], as in Fig. 528;
this can be done with pincers. Then put part <span class="smcap">A</span> in a vice and bend
<span class="smcap">B C</span> and <span class="smcap">D E</span> out at right angles. Cut it the right length so that the
bend will come on a level with the shoeblack's brush and one end
will come above post, <span class="smcap">A</span>. The wire, <span class="smcap">D</span>, should be pointed or well
smoothed with a file at the lower end, so that it will turn easily on
a piece of glass glued to the base.</p>

<p>Wire <span class="smcap">D</span> is supported by two wire hoops or screw-eyes placed in
post <span class="smcap">A</span>. The holes through which it passes must not be too large
or it will wobble and not turn smoothly. Now all the parts are
ready for putting together. Glue the shoeblack on first, then
opposite to him the man. See that the brush passes over the shoe.
If for any reason this does not happen, a larger brush can be cut
from wood or cardboard and pasted over the shoeblack's hand.
Now fasten post <span class="smcap">A</span> behind the man so that the bend of the wire, <span class="smcap">D</span>,
will be in the right position; pass wire, <span class="smcap">D</span>, through the wire loops
or hooks (these are best made of copper wire); glue the top of it
into the hole in the propeller. Glue a piece of glass, <span class="smcap">E</span>, under the
other end. Connect by a thin piece of wire the shoeblack's brush
with bend in <span class="smcap">D</span>. The figure will now work well in the wind.</p>

<p>The shoeblack is the toy one most often sees worked in this way.
A man sawing wood is another favourite model, and can be made
in exactly the same way.</p>

<p>Two knights fighting can also be made; this involves, however,
two propellers.</p>

<p><b>Toys worked by Convection Currents.</b> These are less interesting
toys because they do not admit of much variety. The toy
is worked over a gas burner, where it acts as a ceiling protector.
As the power available from convection currents is very slight,
every care must be taken that the figure will work smoothly.</p>

<p>As the toy is exposed to heat, the soldering must be well done.
Fig. 529 shows how the toy is made.</p>

<p>The little sailor is cut out of sheet metal (tinned plate); his
limbs are fixed by means of rivets or eyelets (the latter are obtainable
at a boot repairer's). Take care that they move freely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
They will do so if the holes are very smooth. The wire used is steel
wire about 1/16 inch; this is fairly easy to bend.</p>

<p>Wire <span class="smcap">A B</span> is bent as already described in the shoeblack. It
passes through loops in the wire at <span class="smcap">A</span> and <span class="smcap">D</span>. It is kept from
slipping through at <span class="smcap">A</span> by a ring of wire soldered on the top.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_317.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 529</span></div>
</div>

<p>The propeller at <span class="smcap">B</span> is simply a tin disc
with radial cuts, each sector being twisted
at an angle by a pair of pliers. The
propeller is held by a turn in the wire and
by a touch of solder. Notice that the feet
of the figure are turned round the wire on
which it stands. They can be soldered for
greater security. The hand is also curled
round the crank pin, but it must be free to
turn on it.</p>

<p>The wire framework, <span class="smcap">E</span>, is soldered to
a circle of tin, <span class="smcap">C</span>, which fits on the top of
the lamp. As the figure has to be small
it should be as long as possible.</p>

<p>A pair of scissors should be kept for
cutting tin, or tinman's snips can be used;
cutting pliers and centre punches will
also be needed. Holes, however, can be
punched in tin with strong round nails
and a hammer. Round files are needed
for making holes smooth.</p>

<p>Empty tin canisters form a supply of
tin plate.</p>

<p>Adjustable cycle spanners are useful
for bending wire at right angles; a hide mallet is a great
convenience.</p>

<p>Before making a toy like one of those described it is well to
practise bending wire with vice, hammer and mallet.</p>

<p>In the last toy, if tinned plate and tinned steel wire are used,
the soldering is a fairly easy matter, because the tinning has already
been done.</p>

BUILDINGS AT HOME AND ABROAD</h3>


<p><b>A Farmhouse.</b> Young children, having cut out of cardboard
or fret-wood the animals and trees described in Chapter XX,
having constructed a bridge, a well, a dove-cot, and other small
models scattered through this volume, take considerable pleasure
in arranging their toys into pretty groups and attractive combinations.
At this stage the lack is often felt of some object of
central interest, of something to 'pull the composition together,'
as an art critic would put it: the farm scene requires a farm, the
domestic scene a villa, the Eastern animals and trees an Indian
temple, or some such building, to complete the picture.</p>

<p>With regard to home scenes, children may be advised at this
stage to make for themselves any house or building that suits their
fancy. The basis of the toy will always be the four walls plus a
roof described in the Noah's Ark (Part I, Chapter X); more complicated
cardboard work has already been studied in the castle
(Part II, Chapter X), so children who are ambitious to achieve
something more picturesque than the Noah's Ark may be advised
to go out into the suburbs or the country, and sketch any simple
building, or set of buildings, which they would like to reproduce.
Such work, once attempted, becomes extremely fascinating, and
leads to very picturesque and delightful results. To do really good
work, however, children must accustom themselves to <i>plan</i> very
carefully what they propose to do, and to convert their sketches
into a set of drawings to scale, which, in the case of a building,
should include at least a ground plan and a couple of elevations.</p>

<p>Figs. 530 and 531 show how to lay down the plan and elevations
of a simple building of the 'Noah's Ark' type, to which
have been added a front and a back door, with porches, bay and
storm windows, chimney-stacks, and an outhouse at the back.
Fig. 532 is the front elevation to half scale.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>The addition of another entirely detached outhouse with wide
door at one end, for a cowshed, to face the back of the main building
and form the third side of a square, will give the nucleus of
quite an attractive farm.</p>

<p>When once the plans have been drawn, a scale is plotted below
to suit any size to which it is intended to build; all the dimensions
shown in plan and elevation are then taken as required with
dividers, read off on the scale, taken anew on a foot-rule, and
transferred to the wood or cardboard.</p>

<p>The scale given on the figure is for quite a large house, the
ground plan of the main building measuring 15 inches by 10 inches,
and that of the outhouse 10 inches by 5 inches. These two buildings
had best be constructed on separate bases, and need not be
permanently joined; the roof of the outhouse can be carried rather
further into that of the main building than is indicated by the line
<span class="smcap">C H E</span>, and the main roof alone cut carefully to the line <span class="smcap">C H E</span>.
If the main roof is made detachable, building <span class="smcap">A B C D</span> will form a
receptacle for the outhouses and the whole farm stock. The
broken line surrounding <span class="smcap">A B C D</span> and <span class="smcap">C E F G</span> indicates the dimensions.</p>

<p>A house of this size is best built with a base and walls of wood
obtained from some grocers' boxes.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> If the scale be marked so
that points 0, 10, 20 read 0, 7&frac12;, 15, giving a reduction to three
quarters, the main building will measure 11&frac14; inches by 7&frac12; inches,
and may be built entirely of cardboard. If the scale be marked
so that points 0, 10, 20 read 0, 5, 10, <span class="smcap">A B</span> and <span class="smcap">A D</span> measuring respectively
7&frac12; inches and 5 inches, we shall have a small model that can
be built of very light materials, such as stout cartridge paper on
a cardboard base.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> An excellent and very strong material for model-building is manufactured
by Messrs James Spicer and Sons Limited, under the name of Rough Cast
Building Board. It has a most realistic white 'rough-cast' surface. It is
obtainable in the size 18&frac12; inches &times; 24 inches from Messrs Richardson and Co.,
Stationers, 176 Charing Cross Road.</p></div>

<p>The bay window will, of course, be made separately, and
gummed into position by means of flanges. The porches may be
detachable, like the outhouse; the front-door porch is built of
eight pillars of stripwood, nailed and glued to a wood or cardboard
base and to cross-beams above; between the pillars may be fixed
a couple of seats, one on each side of the door. The back-door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>porch is supported by four pillars. The roofs are of cardboard.
The ground-floor windows, indicated at W, may be either painted
or cut out; in the latter case they may be made to open or may be
fitted with celluloid window-panes; these you can beg from any
amateur photographer of your acquaintance; he is sure to have
plenty of 'waster' films. The doors should, of course, be made
to open.</p>

<p>The storm windows are easily made; the sides, <span class="smcap">K L M</span>, are cut
with angle <span class="smcap">L K M</span> = half the angle <span class="smcap">K O P</span>, the latter being in the
present instance 72&deg;. The shape of the window roofs can be
arrived at by experimenting with a paper template, but more
accurately by plotting them out to scale.</p>

<p>Thus: draw <span class="smcap">Q' R' V'</span> = <span class="smcap">Q R V</span>, <span class="smcap">R' T'</span> = <span class="smcap">R T</span>, <span class="smcap">Q' S'</span> and <span class="smcap">V' S"</span> = <span class="smcap">Q S</span>;
join <span class="smcap">S' T'</span> and <span class="smcap">S" T'</span>; then <span class="smcap">Q' V' S" T' S'</span> (Fig. 533) is the exact
shape (leaving the flanges out of account) to which the storm-window
roofs should be cut. The roofs over the front porch and
the bay window, the chimney stacks, etc., are thought out and
plotted in the same manner, the solving of these little problems
being excellent practice, which may be turned to good account in
after life.</p>

<p>The village church, the village inn, if it is old and picturesque,
should form good subjects for study and reproduction on the lines
indicated above. For young people who have exhausted the
possibilities of their immediate surroundings we give a few models
from lands more remote.</p>

<p><b>The Taj Mahal, Agra.</b> This is one of the most famous buildings
in India, and was erected by the Emperor Shah Jehan over
the body of his favourite wife. A very pretty model which closely
resembles it can be made as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>In Fig. 534 the dome, <span class="smcap">A</span>, is a plain india-rubber ball, circumference
about 11 inches. Four india-rubber balls, circumference
about 6 inches, are needed as <span class="smcap">B B</span>, and four, circumference about
4&frac12; inches, for the four columns (<span class="smcap">C</span> in Fig. 534) which surround the
temple. Cut a piece of fairly thick cardboard, 7 inches square, for
the roof of the temple. Cut off the corners as in Fig. 535. In the
centre describe a circle with radius 1-3/8 inches, and round it four
smaller circles of radius 7/8 inch.</p>

<p>Cut a strip of thin cardboard 9 inches by 2 inches. Cut as in
Fig. 536, leaving flanges of &frac12; inch. Roll round and fasten together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
with seccotine and two small paper-clips, size 00. This forms the
part of the temple marked <span class="smcap">D</span> in Fig. 534. It is glued to the roof
by the flanges, etc., and ball, <span class="smcap">A</span>, is glued into it.</p>

distances <i>ha</i>, <i>ab</i>, <i>bc</i>, <i>cd</i>, etc. (Fig. 535), on a piece of cardboard,
and mark out as in Fig. 538. Make half cuts along the dotted lines

<p>Make and cut out the windows and arch.</p>

<p>Cut another piece of cardboard similar to this. These two
bent round and joined together form the sides of the temple.</p>

<p>Now cut a piece of cardboard as in Fig. 539, leaving flanges all
round.</p>

<p>Bend it round and gum it together. This is gummed underneath
the roof, before fastening on the outer walls, and serves a
double purpose; it helps to support the roof on which the domes
rest, and prevents the temple from looking too hollow when the
windows are cut out.</p>

<p><b>To make Tower</b>, <span class="smcap">C E</span> (Fig. 534). It consists of three rolls of
thin cardboard, <span class="smcap">E F G</span>, each about 2 inches high, circumference
4&frac12; inches.</p>

<p>Circular pieces of cardboard, big enough to project about
&frac14; inch beyond the columns, form the platforms, <span class="smcap">H</span>, <span class="smcap">J</span>, <span class="smcap">K</span>. Underneath
each platform triangular pieces of cardboard are glued, as
in Fig. 540. Four of these columns stand round the central
building.</p>

<p>It is a great improvement if rings of cardboard, &frac14; inch wide, are
made and glued round all the smaller domes, as shown in Fig. 541.</p>

<p>Round the sides of the building strips of paper, <span class="smcap">L</span>, <span class="smcap">M</span>, <span class="smcap">N</span>, <span class="smcap">O</span>
(Fig. 534), are gummed, rising about &frac12; inch from the roof, with
patterns drawn on them as in Fig. 543. Little cardboard turrets
(Fig. 542) are cut out and gummed in each corner, <span class="smcap">P</span> and <span class="smcap">Q</span> (Fig. 534).
Little cones of paper, made by rolling together a circle cut as in
Fig. 544, may be glued to the tops of the domes.</p>

<p>The whole should be mounted on a platform made of a piece
of stout cardboard, <span class="smcap">X Y</span>, about a foot square or a little larger,
supported on match-boxes placed two together. A row of these
across the middle will prevent the platform from sagging. Trees
can be cut out as in Chapter XX, Figs. 431 and 436, to stand
round the temple.</p>

<p><b>A Pagoda</b>, or memorial tower, in the province of Quei Chow
in China (Fig. 545). This is made of nine hexagonal prisms.
The bottom one is 2 inches high, the sides being also two inches;
the dimensions of the next are 1/8 inch less, the next another 1/8 inch
less, and so on. The last prism has side &frac34; inch, height &frac34; inch.
An ornament for the top can be filed from a cork or piece of
round wood. The platforms project about &frac14; inch beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
prisms; the supports may be cardboard or pieces of thin wood.
The prisms are fastened together as described in the case of the
lighthouse (Chapter XIII). The whole should be painted to
represent stones, and doors marked on as in Fig. 545.</p>

<p>Fig. 546 shows a <b>Mosque</b> in an oasis in the Sahara Desert.
Here the dome, <span class="smcap">A</span>, an india-rubber ball, is let into a circular hole in
the roof. The towers or minarets are prisms of cardboard on top
of each other, surmounted by a piece of dowel rod, one end being
rounded to a point. Trees can be cut out as in the figure to form
a background.</p>

<p>Fig. 547 shows a <b>Japanese Pagoda</b>. This is built up in a similar
manner to the Chinese pagoda. Parts <span class="smcap">A B C D</span> are square prisms
about 1 inch high; <span class="smcap">E F G</span> are truncated square prisms. They are
made like the reservoir described in the models worked by sand
(Chapter XXI), but the upper parts have been cut off; they are
glued to the squares of cardboard which rest upon the tops of
<span class="smcap">A</span>, <span class="smcap">B</span>, <span class="smcap">C</span> and <span class="smcap">D</span>.</p>

<p>A piece of cardboard is glued over the top of <span class="smcap">E</span> so that <span class="smcap">B</span> can
rest upon it, and so on with the others; pieces of paper cut out as
at <span class="smcap">H J</span> are gummed round the edges. There are many interesting
models that can be made in this way. Almost any good illustrated
geography book will provide plenty of material from which pretty
and interesting foreign scenes can be built up.</p>

A THEATRE</h3>


<p>This is a toy that will provide hours of happy play.</p>

<p>There are many effective ways of making a toy theatre, and
the planning and designing of one is a pleasant piece of work.
This chapter gives a few suggestions to future theatre builders, who
must adopt those that appeal most to them. A large stage is the
most necessary part, so that there is plenty of room to set up the
scenes and room for the actors. A small stage limits the choice
of plays considerably.</p>

<p>A pretty and useful theatre can be made thus. Get a wooden
box 8&frac34; inches wide, about 1 foot long and 2&frac14; inches deep. (The
theatre described in this chapter was made from a wooden box
containing Fry's Nut Milk Chocolate&mdash;this box is exactly the right
size.) This box forms the basis of the platform; stand it bottom
upward, nail to the back of it a piece of wood, <span class="smcap">G H C D</span>, which is
1 foot square (see Fig. 548). The platform, <span class="smcap">A B L M</span>, is a piece
of stiff cardboard or wood, <span class="smcap">A B</span> is length of box, <span class="smcap">L M</span> is 2 feet.
This makes a fine large platform for arranging scenes.</p>

<p>Pieces of stripwood &frac14; inch by &frac12; inch are glued across the platform,
<span class="smcap">A L B M</span>, each strip a little over a &frac14; inch from the other (the
&frac14; inch side is glued to platform). About eleven strips can be
thus glued across; their ends should project about &frac14; inch beyond
the platform.</p>

<p>The grooves thus formed are for running the actors up and
down in.</p>

<p>A piece of wood, <i>a b c d</i>, is now cut 2 feet by 3&frac14; inches.</p>

<p>Holes are drilled along the top of it about &frac14; inch in diameter,
and red paper gummed at the back of them for the footlights.
Panels or a pretty design of some kind should be painted on it, or
it may have coloured paper pasted on it. This piece of wood is
glued to <span class="smcap">K J E F</span> so that its ends project equally on each side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">
<img src="images/i_328.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 548</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>Now cut two pieces of stripwood &frac12;" &times; &frac14;" &times; 16&frac14;" (<i>e b</i> and <i>f d</i> in
Fig. 548). Bevel the top ends to hold up cardboard roof <i>e f</i> <span class="smcap">G H</span>
(the measurements for which can be easily found). The roof is
secured by a flap glued behind <span class="smcap">A G H B</span>, the roof is also glued to
the tops of the strips <i>eb</i> and <i>fd</i>. These posts are glued to sides of
<i>abcd</i>. Before they are glued on, however, they must have holes
drilled near their upper ends for pole, <span class="smcap">N O</span>, to pass through. The
curtain must be made of fairly thin stuff glued to pole, <span class="smcap">N O</span>. It can
be pulled up and down by means of pulley wheels attached on
each side. (For making pulley see Part I, Chapter XIV.) Pieces
of lead can be sewn in the corners to make the curtain run down
more easily.</p>

<p>Saw cuts are made across the strips of wood that cover the
platform along lines <span class="smcap">B M</span> and <span class="smcap">A L</span>. Into these slits the side scenes
fit. These side scenes are cut out of cardboard and have drawings
and painting on them according to the story that is being acted.
They must have slits cut in them (corresponding to the grooves in
the platform), the number of slits depending on the number of
actors. For example in Fig. 548 side scene <span class="smcap">H</span> <i>f</i> <span class="smcap">B M</span> has an open door
through which Red Riding Hood can be pushed. She is cut out
of either cardboard or wood, and glued to the end of a piece of
stripwood, &frac14; inch by &frac14; inch, by means of which she is pushed from
the side along the groove in the stage and so off through the corresponding
slit in scene <span class="smcap">G</span> <i>e</i> <span class="smcap">L A</span>. (In Fig. 548 the Wolf is looking
through this slot.) The window in scene <span class="smcap">H</span> <i>f</i> <span class="smcap">B M</span> can be made to
open and show the Grandmother inside. The cardboard scene,
<span class="smcap">G H A B</span>, is kept in its place by pieces of wire (<i>h</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>h</i>) fastened
at the back and bent over.</p>

<p>Almost any story can be acted in this theatre. All the actors
are fastened to lengths of stripwood by means of which they are
passed in and out. Sometimes two, three or more may be fastened
to one length. The number of openings in the side scenes will,
of course, depend on the story being acted.</p>

<p>Trees, etc., can also be cut out as described in Chapter XX
(Part II), and stood about.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>A sea scene looks very effective. Waves can be cut out of
cardboard and placed in every groove, as in Fig. 549, and a ship
drawn across. A shipwreck forms an exciting scene. Indeed,
there is no end to the scenes&mdash;soldiers marching past, stories and
scenes from history and literature, etc., etc. The ingenious
owner of the theatre will think of many, and add many improvements.
It must not be forgotten that the stage is large enough to
hold small objects&mdash;trees, etc.&mdash;to make the scenes look more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
realistic. Also holes or slits can be made in the roof if it is necessary
to pull anything up or hang anything. Fig. 549 shows how
a fringe of paper, <span class="smcap">A</span>, can be fastened to the roof and bent over to
hide the pole on which the curtain is wound.</p>

<p>Fig. 550 shows how the scenes are worked; as the Witch is
pushed on from one side, the weeping Cinderella is pushed off;
when she has quite gone and only the Witch remains, a radiant
Cinderella comes on, followed by a coach, etc.</p>

<p>Lastly, Fig. 551 shows a proscenium, which may be built up of
either cardboard or wood, and fixed to the front of the theatre.
The sides should project sufficiently to hide the working of the
strips by means of which the actors are moved on the stage.</p>

<p>Here, for the present, we take leave of the reader, having given
him or her some insight into a subject both pleasant and profitable.
The preceding pages are no more than an introduction to the art
of making toys, and of making the most of simple tools and simple
materials, and their real purpose is to encourage our young people
not only to copy but also to create, or at any rate to copy not only
from our book but from the world around them.</p>

<p>Dolls' houses and furniture, railways, boats and other vehicles
offer endless possibilities of original and attractive design, and
mechanical toys, whether driven by wind, water, elastic or the
works of an old clock, offer an equally wide field for invention.
At a later age girls will no doubt be ambitious to devise useful
articles for the home, while boys may become interested in engineering
and electrical models, optical toys, etc.; the deftness of
hand, acquaintance with elementary principles, and self-confidence
acquired through the simple work which we have described, should
stand them in good stead.</p>

<p>Self-reliance and ingenuity are valuable assets with which to
start upon the more serious tasks of life, and if our hints on toy-making
contribute in any way to the development of these qualities
this book will not have been written in vain.</p>
